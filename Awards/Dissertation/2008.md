>  "This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
>  problems of tracking down and tolerating software errors in
>  deployed systems. It proposes a variety of techniques, ranging from
>  a breakthrough, probabilistic method of compactly representing
>  calling contexts, to novel techniques for tracking null pointers,
>  to garbage collector modifications that let programs tolerate
>  memory leaks. The evaluation committee was impressed by Michael's
>  fresh perspective on these problems and the thorough experimental
>  evaluation by which he backs up his claims. His research has
>  already had broad adoption and impact, and we believe that his
>  techniques will be brought to bear on a wide range of future
>  applications."

>  "This dissertation introduces a novel logic for reasoning about
>  concurrent shared-memory programs. This logic subsumes both
>  rely/guarantee reasoning and separation logic in an elegant and
>  natural manner. The dissertation establishes the semantic
>  properties of the logic and demonstrates its applicability on a
>  range of highly complex concurrent algorithms and data structures.
>  The evaluation committee found the clarity of Viktor's presentation
>  and the technical depth of his results particularly compelling, and
>  we believe that this work creates a foundation for new tools and
>  automated techniques for reasoning about concurrent programs."
