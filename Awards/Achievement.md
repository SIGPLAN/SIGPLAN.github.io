title: "Programming Languages Achievement Award"
---

Given by ACM SIGPLAN to recognize an individual (or individuals) who
has (have) made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of
Programming Languages. The contribution can be a single event or a
lifetime of achievement. The award includes a prize of $5,000. The
award is presented at SIGPLAN's [PLDI conference](/Conferences/PLDI)
the following June.

All questions about the Programming Languages Achievement Award should
be directed to the SIGPLAN Awards co-Chairs.

#### Nominations

Nominations can be submitted at
<https://sigplan-pl-achievement26.hotcrp.com/>.  Nominations submitted on or before
January 15th will be considered for award that year.  A nomination
for the Achievement Award that is not selected will remain in
consideration for a total of three years.

Each nomination should be submitted as a single PDF consisting of the following items:

-   Name, affiliation, phone number, and email address of the candidate
    for whom an award is recommended (the nominee).
-   Name, affiliation, phone number, and email address of the person
    making the nomination (the nominator).
-   A short statement (200-500 words) explaining why the nominee
    deserves the award.
-   Names and email addresses of 5-10 people who the nominator
    believes will support the nomination. The awards committee will
    ask at least three of these people for their opinions. (If the nominator 
    already has support letters these can be included with the nomination)

#### Committee

Award recipients are selected by a committee constituted as follows:
* The Chair of the committee shall be a member of the SIGPLAN
  Executive Committee (EC), and shall be appointed by the executive
  committee.
* The SIGPLAN EC Chair shall be an ex-officio member of the committee.
  If the SIGPLAN EC Chair is unable to serve, he or she may appoint
  another member of the SIGPLAN EC as a substitute.
* The steering committees of the major SIGPLAN Conferences, POPL,
  PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH, shall each appoint a member to the
  committee.

The current committee is:
* [Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html), Cornell U (Chair)
* [Andrew Myers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/), Cornell U (ex-officio)
* [Işil Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil), U Texas, Austin (PLDI)
* [Amal Ahmed](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/amal/), Northeastern U (POPL)
* [Sukyoung Ryu](https://plrg.kaist.ac.kr/ryu), KAIST (ICFP)
* [Eliot Moss](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~moss/), University of Massachusetts Amherst (SPLASH)

#### Conflicts of Interest

Because this award is intended to recognize persons of major
influence, it is likely that several members of the committee may have
worked with, or co-authored articles with, the nominees, and may have
a conflict of interest. The primary mechanism for handling such
conflicts will be to declare them to the committee; once so declared,
conflicts of interest shall not automatically prevent a committee
member from taking part in the selection process. However, if a member
of the committee, or the chair of the committee, feels that the
association of a committee member with a nominee would interfere with
impartial consideration of the nominees, that conflicted member shall
be absented from the relevant parts of the discussion. If a committee
member has conflicts of interest with more than one nominee, the Chair
of the Committee may ask the constituency that appointed the committee
member to select a replacement member.  The SIGPLAN EC Chair will
adjudicate as necessary.
