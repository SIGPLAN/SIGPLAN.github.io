title: "Robin Milner Young Researcher Award"
---
The Robin Milner Young Researcher Award is given by ACM SIGPLAN to
recognize outstanding contributions by young investigators in the
area of programming languages. Individuals are eligible if their
computer-related professional career (graduate school or full-time
employment, whichever began first) started no earlier than 20 years
prior to the nominations deadline. The award includes a prize of $2,500.

**Robin Milner** (13 January, 1934 - 20 March, 2010)

Robin Milner was, for decades, a leading light in programming
language research, developing many of the ideas that now form the
backbone of the field. Among Milner's biggest gifts to the field
was his passion for mentoring and nurturing young colleagues, many
of whom have grown into world leaders in their own right. It seems
fitting that an award be established in his name to further
encourage new generations of outstanding researchers.

Milner's academic career began with posts at City University
(University of London), Swansea, and Stanford. In 1973 he joined
the University of Edinburgh, where in 1986 he co-founded the
legendary Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS). In
1995 he left Edinburgh for Cambridge, where he was head of the
Computer Laboratory for several years. He became a Fellow of the
Royal Society in 1998 and received the Turing Award in 1991. The
Turing Award citation includes this capsule summary of his
contributions:

> Working in challenging areas of computer science for twenty years,
> Robin Milner has the distinction of establishing an international
> reputation for three distinct and complete achievements, each of
> which has had and will continue to have a marked, important, and
> widespread effect on both the theory and practice of computer
> science:
> 
> LCF, the mechanization of Scott's Logic of Computable Functions,
> probably the first theoretically based yet practical tool for
> machine-assisted proof construction.
> ML, the first language to include polymorphic type inference
> together with a type-safe exception-handling mechanism.
> CCS, a general theory of concurrency.
> In addition, he formulated and strongly advanced full abstraction,
> the study of the relationship between operational and denotational
> semantics.

A key ingredient in all of his work has been his ability to combine
deep insight into mathematical foundations of the subject with an
equally deep view of the key engineering issues, thus allowing the
feedback of theory into practice in an exciting way. Further, his
style of scholarship, rigor, and attention to aesthetic quality
sets a high example for all to follow.  

**Selection Processs**

Nominations will be due on the fifth of January of each year. The
recipients of the award will be selected by the SIGPLAN Awards
committee, which is constituted as follows. (1) The Chair of the
Awards committee shall be a member of the SIGPLAN Executive
Committee, and shall be appointed by the executive committee. (2)
The Chair of the SIGPLAN EC shall be an ex-officio member of the
Awards committee. If the EC Chair is unable to serve, he or she may
appoint another member of the EC as a substitute. (3) The steering
committees of the major SIGPLAN Conferences, POPL, PLDI, ICFP, and
SPLASH, shall each appoint a member to the Awards Committee. The
committee shall also have the option to decline to make an award in
a given year, if no suitable nominations are presented.
 
At the discretion of the SIGPLAN Awards Committee, eligibility may
be adjusted for documented family-related or medical leave from
employment. Questions about eligibility should be directed to the
Secretary of SIGPLAN.

**Conflicts of Interest**

Because these awards are intended to recognize persons and software systems of major influence, it is likely that several members of the awards committee may have worked with, or co-authored articles with, the nominees, and may have a conflict of interest. The primary mechanism for handling such conflicts will be to declare them to the committee; once so declared, conflicts of interest shall not automatically prevent a committee member from taking part in the selection process. However, if a member of the committee, or the chair of the committee, feels that the association of a committee member with a nominee would interfere with impartial consideration of the nominees, a committee member shall be absented from the relevant parts of the discussion. If the same committee member has conflicts of interest with more than one nominee, the Chair of the Awards Committee may ask the constituency that appointed the committee member to select a replacement member.

**Clarification**

Note that, in consultation with the ACM Awards Board, the wording of
the Milner Award eligibility requirement has been updated to clarify
that the 20-year time frame is in relation to the nomination
*deadline* (rather than the vague "time of nomination" as was
originally written).
