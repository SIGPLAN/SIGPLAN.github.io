> "Chris Lattner receives the SIGPLAN Software Award as the author of
> the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, which has had a dramatic impact
> on our field. LLVM is being used extensively in both products and
> research, for traditional and non-traditional compiler problems,
> and for a diverse set of languages. LLVM has had a significant
> influence on academic research, not just in compilers but also in
> other areas, such as FPGA design tool. Many researchers cite the
> "elegance of LLVM's design" as one of the reasons for using LLVM.
> LLVM has also had an impact on industrial projects and products; it
> is used at major companies including Apple and Google. For example,
> LLVM is an integral part of Apple's software stack in Mac OS X.
> Furthermore, as with academic research, LLVM is finding its way
> into unexpected applications of compiler technology. In summary,
> LLVM has had an incredible impact on both industry and academia and
> its elegance has enabled it to be used for a wide range of
> applications."
