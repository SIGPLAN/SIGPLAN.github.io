> "Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow receive the SIGPLAN Software
> Award as the authors of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), which
> is the preeminent lazy functional programming system for industry,
> teaching, and research. GHC has not only provided a language
> implementation, but also established the whole paradigm of lazy
> functional programming and formed the foundation of a large and
> enthusiastic user community. GHC's flexibility has supported
> experimental research on programming language design in areas as
> diverse as monads, generalized algebraic data types, rank-N
> polymorphism, and software transactional memory. Indeed, a large
> share of the research on lazy functional programming in the last
> 5-10 years has been carried out with GHC. Simultaneously, GHC's
> reliability and efficiency has encouraged commercial adoption, in
> the financial sector in institutions like Credit Suisse and
> Standard Chartered Bank, and for high assurance software in
> companies like Amgen, Eaton, and Galois.
> 
> A measure of GHC's influence is the way that many of the ideas of
> purely functional, "typeful programming" have been carried into
> newer languages and language features. including C\#, F\#, Java
> Generics, LINQ, Perl 6, Python, and Visual Basic 9.0. Peyton Jones
> and Marlow have been visionary in the way that they have
> transitioned research into practice. They have been role models and
> leaders in creating the large and diverse Haskell community, and
> have made GHC an industrial-strength platform for commercial
> development as well as for research."
