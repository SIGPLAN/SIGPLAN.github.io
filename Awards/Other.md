A number of awards are regularly presented at SIGPLAN-sponsored events, but are
not awarded directly by SIGPLAN.

## ASPLOS Most Influential Paper Award

The ASPLOS Most Influential Paper Award recognizes a historical ASPLOS paper
that has had major influence on the field. The Program Committee nominates
highly influential papers from any ASPLOS conference that occurred ten or more
conferences ago, with the final selection being made by the ASPLOS Steering
Committee.

## John Vlissides Award

In recognition of the contributions to computer science that John
Vlissides made during his lifetime, SIGPLAN has established the

student participating in the OOPSLA Doctoral Symposium showing
significant promise in applied software research. All doctoral
candidates participating in the annual OOPSLA Doctoral Symposium
