The SPLASH Doctoral Symposium is a one-day event aimed at mid-stage doctoral students in programming languages or software engineering who have progressed far enough in their research to have a structured proposal but who will not be defending their dissertation in the next 12 months. Successful applicants will have the opportunity to present their research ideas to an international panel of senior computer science professors for critique and discussion.

Doctoral Symposium participants will also automatically be considered for SIGPLANâ€™s John Vlissides award, which comes with a cash prize of $2,000.

This year, SPLASH and ICFP will be co-located in Singapore, with the SPLASH Doctoral Symposium taking place in Singapore's famous Marina Bay Sands convention centre on Monday 13th October.

Important dates:
Submission - Thursday 31st July 2025 (EOD AOE)
Notifications - Friday 8th August 2025
Symposium - Monday 13th October 2025
