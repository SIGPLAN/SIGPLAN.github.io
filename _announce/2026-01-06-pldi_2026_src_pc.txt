PLDI 2026 Call for Self-nominations for the SRC Program Committee
=================================================================

We are looking for motivated researchers to be members of the PLDI 2026 Student Research Competition Program Committee (SRC PC).

This year, we are accepting self-nominations for the SRC PC. The self-nomination form is available at: https://forms.gle/KSacbLEtw1Yw8gkx7.
The nominations for you (or someone you are nominating) are due by Jan. 16, 2026. Also, please note that the nominee needs to have (or will have by June) a PhD in order to judge SRC submissions.

As a committee member, the primary responsibilities would be to review short papers submitted by junior researchers to the competition. We expect each PC member to have 4-6 3-page papers assigned in round 1 and 0-1 papers assigned for shepherding (providing additional feedback prior to camera-ready submissions for accepted papers).

Full details about the PLDI 2026 SRC can be found at: https://pldi26.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2026-src

Come join us in providing high-quality feedback to junior researchers in the PLDI community!
