The WebAssembly Workshop (WAW) at ICFP / SPLASH 2025 aims to bring together researchers, standards body members, and industry practitioners, in order to continue and foster a growing trend of academic contributions to the WebAssembly ecosystem spanning verification, security, and programming language analysis and theory.

We enthusiastically request WebAssembly-related abstract submissions, including prior, ongoing, and early-stage work, for presentation and discussion at the workshop.
