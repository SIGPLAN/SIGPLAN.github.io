Greetings,

On behalf of the SIGMETRICS 2026 TPC, we hope this email finds you well. We are reaching out to solicit applications for the *SIGMETRICS Shadow PC*, a new program for the 2026 conference.

The goal of the Shadow PC is to provide experience reviewing SIGMETRICS submissions to PhD students, postdocs, and early-career faculty members who are not on the TPC for this year’s conference. Shadow PC members will be asked to review roughly 3 or 4 papers submitted to the SIGMETRICS 2026 Winter Deadline. These reviews will not be used by the TPC in any way, but are designed to let Shadow PC members get practice reviewing papers and to see what TPC discussions and deliberations are like behind the scenes. Additionally, it can be helpful to read and discuss a range of typical SIGMETRICS submissions to further hone your sense of what makes a strong paper in our community. Shadow PC reviews will ultimately be released to the authors about a week after acceptance decisions are released, so feedback from these reviews will also be a great service as authors revise their work or prepare a final version.

We are asking people who are interested in serving on the Shadow PC to complete a brief application describing their experience reviewing or writing papers (not mandatory), their level of familiarity with the SIGMETRICS / Performance Evaluation community, and their areas of expertise. We ask that interested applicants complete this application form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctYp4YF2wuWIvPMjJwQXbH8VR0Rg-hBC21b4SOfVrZy6YmGA/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=117810560432574827520
> by *November 21st, 2025*.

If you have any questions or issues completing this form, please contact the Shadow PC chairs Ben Berg and Céline Comte at sigmetrics26shadowtpcchairs@sigmetrics.org. Please also feel free to forward this invitation to any potential applicants we may have missed.

Best,
-Ben and Céline
