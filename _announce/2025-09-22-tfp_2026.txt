# TFP 2026 -- Call for Papers
(trendsfp.github.io)

## Important Dates

* Submission deadline (pre-symposium, full papers): Thu 13th Nov 2025 (AOE)
* Notification        (pre-symposium, full papers): Thu 11th Dec 2025
* Submission deadline (pre-symposium draft papers): Thu 11th Dec 2025 (AOE)
* Notification        (pre-symposium draft papers): Fri 19th Dec 2025
* Submission deadline (post-symposium review):      Thu  5th Mar 2026 (AOE)
* Notification        (post-symposium submissions): Thu 16th Apr 2026

The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional programming,
taking a broad view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires to be a
lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and other
contributions.

This year, TFP will take place in-person at the University of Southern Denmark,
in Odense, Denmark. It is co-located with the Trends in Functional Programming
in Education (TFPIE) workshop, which will take on the day before the main
symposium.

Please be aware that TFP has several submission deadlines. The first, 13th
November, is for authors who wish to have their full paper reviewed prior to the
symposium. Papers that are accepted in this way must also be presented at the
symposium. The second, 11th December, is for authors who wish to present their
work or work-in-progress at the symposium first without submitting to the full
review process for publication. These authors can then take into account
feedback received at the symposium and submit a full paper for review by the
third deadline, 19th February.

## Scope

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various routes. As
part of the Symposium’s focus on trends we therefore identify the following five
paper categories. High-quality submissions are solicited in any of these
categories:

*   Research Papers: Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
*   Position Papers: On what new trends should or should not be
*   Project Papers: Descriptions of recently started new projects
*   Evaluation Papers: What lessons can be drawn from a finished project
*   Overview Papers: Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication to any
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming:
theoretical, implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of
functional programming techniques to other languages are also within the scope
of the symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

*   Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
*   Functional programming in the cloud
*   High performance functional computing
*   Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
*   Dependently typed functional programming
*   Validation and verification of functional programs
*   Debugging and profiling for functional languages
*   Functional programming in different application areas: 
    security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded systems, 
    global computing, grids, etc.
*   Interoperability with imperative programming languages
*   Novel memory management techniques
*   Program analysis and transformation techniques
*   Empirical performance studies
*   Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
*   (Embedded) domain specific languages
*   New implementation strategies
*   Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP, please
contact the programme chair, Casper Bach.

## Best Paper Awards

TFP awards two prizes for the best papers each year.

First, to reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best
overall paper accepted for the post-conference formal proceedings.

Second, each year TFP also awards a prize for the best student paper. TFP
traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging that
students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student paper is
one for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of students,
the students are the paper’s first authors, and a student would present the
paper.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the best paper
happens to be a student paper, then that paper will receive both prizes.

## Instructions to Authors

Submission is via HotCRP:

  https://tfp26.hotcrp.com/

Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally
reviewed either before or after the Symposium. Further, pre-symposium
submissions may either be full (earlier deadline) or draft papers (later
deadline). See below for more details.

Submission is single-blind.

Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the chair).

Accepted papers from the pre-symposium and post-symposium formal review will
appear in a formal proceedings, published by Springer.

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For more
information about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS Guidelines web
site
(https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

### Pre-symposium formal review

Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted before
the early deadline and will receive their reviews and notification of acceptance
for both presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that has
been rejected for publication but accepted for presentation may be revised and
resubmitted for the post-symposium formal review.

### Post-symposium formal review

Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance for
presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit
revised papers based on the feedback received at the symposium. A post-symposium
refereeing process will then select a subset of these papers for formal
publication.

### Paper categories

Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as extended
abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (up to 20 pages). The
submission must clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research,
position, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which
authors are research students, and whether the main author(s) are students. A
draft paper for which all authors are students will receive additional feedback
by one of the PC members shortly after the symposium has taken place.
