===============================================================================
	      10th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on
	     Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design
				(FARM)

===============================================================================
				   
The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM 2022 will feature an afternoon session of demos, and an evening
session with a keynote and live performances.
