Papers accepted will be published in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to be presented at the SPLASH conference in October 2023. 

### Scope

The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.

### Review Process  

PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two _rounds_ of reviewing. The final outcome of each round can be one of Accept, Revise, or Reject.

*Accept*: Accepted papers will appear at the next PACMPL(OOPSLA).

*Revise*: Papers in this category are invited to submit a revision to the _next round_ of submissions with a specific set of expectations to be met.  When authors resubmit, they should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will be re-evaluated.  Resubmitted papers will retain the same reviewers throughout the process.

*Reject*: Rejected papers will not be included in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Papers in this category are not guaranteed a review if resubmitted less than one year from the date of original submission. A paper will be judged to be a resubmission if it is substantially similar to the original submission. The judgment that a paper is a resubmission of the same work and whether, in this case, it will be reviewed or not is at the discretion of the Chair. Obviously, this same policy applies to papers that were rejected for inclusion in the 2022 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).

Each _round_ of reviewing consists of two _phases_. The first phase evaluates the papers and results in an early notification of Reject, Revise, or Conditional Accept. During the first phase, authors will be able to read their reviews and respond to them. The second phase is restricted to conditionally accepted papers. Authors must make a set of mandatory revisions. The second phase assesses whether the required revisions have been addressed. The outcome can be Accept, Revise, or Reject.

### Submissions

Submitted papers must be at most **23 pages** in 10 point font. There is no page limit on references. No appendices are allowed on the main paper, instead authors can upload supplementary material with no page or content restrictions, but reviewers may choose to ignore it. Submissions must adhere to the "ACM Small" template available from [the ACM](http://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions). Papers are expected to use author-year citations. Author-year citations may be used as either a noun phrase, such as "The lambda calculus was originally conceived by Church [1932]", or a parenthetic phase, such as "The lambda calculus [Church 1932] was intended as a foundation for mathematics".

PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors' identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must

1. omit author names and institutions,
2. use the third person when referencing your work,
3. anonymize supplementary material.

Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the FAQ on the OOPSLA 2023 website for details. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by [SIGPLAN's Republication Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication). Submitters should also be aware of [ACM's Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy). Submissions are expected to comply with the [ACM Policies for Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/information-for-authors).

### Artifacts

Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts.

### Publication

PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge ($400), but payment is not required. The official publication date is the date when the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers may be published up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference.
