Dear all,

We are looking for motivated students and researchers to be members of
the PLDI 2026 Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC,
https://pldi26.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2026-pldi-research-artifacts ).
The artifact evaluation process aims to promote, share, and catalog the
research artifacts of papers accepted to the PLDI research track.

This year, we are accepting self-nominations for the AEC. The
self-nomination form is available at:
https://forms.gle/jKfzM19KPENqsPoR7
The first round of nominations ends on Dec 22nd, 2025.

As a committee member, the primary responsibilities would be to review
the artifacts submitted corresponding to the already accepted papers in
the main research track. In particular, you may have to run the
associated tool, check whether the results in the main paper can be
reproduced, and inspect the data.

We expect the bulk of the review work to take place between early March
and late April. Each artifact will take about 8h to review, and
reviewers will be assigned about 3 artifacts to review.

Come join us in improving the quality of research in our field!

Best regards,
Raphaël Monat and Qirun Zhang
