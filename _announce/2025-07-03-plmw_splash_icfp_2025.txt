We are on the organizing committee of the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at SPLASH + ICFP 2025, in Singapore on Sunday October 12, 2025, and we are looking for students who are interested in programming languages and software engineering research to apply!

The workshop is aimed at late-stage undergraduates interested in graduate school, as well as early-career Masters/PhD students. We would like to ask you to reach out to students who may be interested in programming languages, as well as software engineering, and
encourage them to apply.

A key mission of this workshop is to increase the participation in programming languages and software engineering research by students who apply to (and, crucially, remain in) PhD programs. Attending conferences is often a transformative experience for students and can go a long way to make them feel part of the research community. Coupled with the mentorship that PLMW provides, we hope to build excitement about research and nurture a welcoming environment.

Weâ€™ve attached a flyer that explains what programming languages research is and why students might want to apply to PLMW. They can find more information and insights from previous participants at the workshop website:
https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/PLMW-ICFP-SPLASH-2025

Students who are interested in attending the workshop and would like to request funding to do so must fill out a short application by the deadline of July 15, 2025.

PLMW highly encourages applicants from first time conference attendees. We are always happy to answer questions from you and from students!

Thanks in advance,
