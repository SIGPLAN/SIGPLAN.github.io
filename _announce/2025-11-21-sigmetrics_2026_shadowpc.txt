Greetings,

**We are extending the application deadline for the SIGMETRICS Shadow PC to December 4th**. If you have not yet had a chance, please consider completing an application <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctYp4YF2wuWIvPMjJwQXbH8VR0Rg-hBC21b4SOfVrZy6YmGA/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=117810560432574827520
> for this opportunity to get hands-on experience reviewing SIGMETRICS submissions.

The goal of the Shadow PC is to provide experience reviewing SIGMETRICS submissions to PhD students, postdocs, and early-career faculty members who are not on the TPC for this year’s conference. Shadow PC members will be asked to review roughly 3 or 4 papers submitted to the SIGMETRICS 2026 Winter Deadline. These reviews will not be used by the TPC in any way, but are designed to let Shadow PC members get practice reviewing papers and to see what TPC discussions and deliberations are like behind the scenes. Additionally, it can be helpful to read and discuss a range of typical SIGMETRICS submissions to further hone your sense of what makes a strong paper in our community. Shadow PC reviews will ultimately be released to the authors about a week after acceptance decisions are released, so feedback from these reviews will also be a great service as authors revise their work or prepare a final version.

Shadow PC members will review papers from the SIGMETRICS 2026 Winter Deadline (January 13th, 2026). Reviews will be assigned to Shadow PC members the following week (around January 18th), and the deadline for Shadow PC members to submit their review will be mid-February. We will then have a few weeks to discuss the reviews and reach a final decision.

If you have any questions or issues completing the form, please contact the Shadow PC chairs Ben Berg and Céline Comte at sigmetrics26shadowtpcchairs@sigmetrics.org. Please also feel free to forward this invitation to any potential applicants we may have missed.

Best,
-Ben and Céline
