TFPIE 2026 Call for papers
https://wiki.tfpie.science.ru.nl/TFPIE2026
(January 26th 2026, Odense, Denmark, co-located with TFP 2026 at University of Southern Denmark)

TFPIE 2026 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom, tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

-  FP and beginning CS students
-  FP and Computational Thinking
-  FP and Artificial Intelligence
-  FP in Robotics
-  FP and Music
-  Advanced FP for undergraduates
-  FP in graduate education
-  Engaging students in research using FP
-  FP in Programming Languages
-  FP in the high school curriculum
-  FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics
-  FP and Philosophy
-  The pedagogy of teaching FP
-  FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.
-  Best Lectures - more details below

In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. What's your best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to present FP concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best lecture topics will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees. The length of the presentation should be comparable to that of a paper. In addition, the speaker can provide commentary on effectiveness or student feedback.

## Submissions

Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or a draft paper (up to 20 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted presentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on the workshop's website.

Papers and abstracts can be submitted via easychair at the following link:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2026

After the workshop, presenters are invited to submit (a revised version of) their article for the formal review. The PC will select the best articles for publication in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS). Articles rejected for presentation and extended abstracts will not be formally reviewed by the PC.
