Q&A sessions, discussions, and social events.  Participants include
practitioners and researchers from industry, academia, and government
organizations active in the promotion and development of reliable
software technologies.

The topics of interest for the conference include but are not limited
to (more specific topics are described on the conference web page):
- Formal and Model-Based Engineering of Critical Systems;
- High-Integrity Systems and Reliability;
- AI for High-Integrity Systems Engineering;
- Real-Time Systems;

- Applications in relevant domains.

More specific topics are described on the conference web page,
at www.ada-europe.org/conference2025.

*** Call for Journal Track Submissions

Following a journal-first model, this edition of the conference
includes a journal track, which seeks original and high-quality
papers that describe mature research work on the conference topics.
Accepted journal track papers will be published in a Special Issue of
Elsevier JSA - the Journal of Systems Architecture (Q1 ranked, CiteScore
8.5, impact factor 3.7).  Accordingly, the conference is listed as
"Journal Published" in the latest update of the CORE Conference
Ranking released in August 2023.

[Submission details removed.  Call is closed now.]

be invited to present their work at the conference.  The abstract of
the accepted contributions will be included in the conference booklet.

Please note that the Ada-Europe organization will waive the Open
Access fees for the first four accepted papers, which do not already
enjoy OA from other agreements with the Publisher.  Subsequent papers
will follow JSA regular publishing track.

*** Call for Industrial Track Submissions

The conference seeks industrial-practitioner presentations that deliver
insight on the challenges of developing reliable software.  Especially
welcome kinds of submissions are listed on the conference web site.
Given their applied nature, such contributions will be subject to a
dedicated practitioner.peer-review process.  Interested authors shall
submit a one-to-two pages abstract, by 24 February 2025, via EasyChair
at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aeic2025, selecting the
"Industrial Track".  The format for submission is strictly in PDF,
following the Ada User Journal style.  Templates are available at
http://www.ada-europe.org/auj/guide.

The abstracts of the accepted contributions will be included in the
conference booklet.  The corresponding authors will get a presentation
slot in the prime-time technical program of the conference and will
also be invited to expand their contributions into full-fledged
articles for publication in the Ada User Journal, which will form
the proceedings of the industrial track of the Conference.

Prospective authors may direct all enquiries regarding this track to
its chairs, Daniela Cancila and Laurent Gouzenes.

*** Call for Work-in-progress Track Submissions

The work-in-progress (WiP) track seeks two kinds of submissions:
(a) ongoing research and (b) early-stage ideas.  Ongoing research
submissions are 4-page papers describing research results that are
not mature enough to be submitted to the journal track.  Early-stage
ideas are 1-page papers that pitch new research directions that fall
within the scope of the conference.  Both kinds of submissions must
be original and shall undergo anonymous peer review.  Submissions
by recent MSc graduates and PhD students are especially sought.
Authors shall submit their work by 24 February 2025, via EasyChair

at http://www.ada-europe.org/auj/guide.

The abstracts of the accepted contributions will be included in the
conference booklet.  The corresponding authors will get a presentation
slot in the prime-time technical program of the conference and will
also be offered the opportunity to expand their contributions into
4-page articles for publication in the Ada User Journal, which will
form the proceedings of the WiP track of the conference.

Prospective authors may direct all enquiries regarding this track to
the corresponding chairs, Hai Nam Tran and Anish Bhobe.

*** Award

The Ada-Europe organization will offer an honorary award for the
best technical presentation, to be announced in the closing session
of the conference.

*** Call for Tutorials

The conference seeks tutorials in the form of educational
seminars on themes falling within the conference scope, with an
academic-for-practitioner slant, including hands-on or practical
elements.

Tutorial proposals shall include a title, an abstract, a description
of the topic, an outline of the presentation, the proposed
duration (half-day or full-day), the intended level of the contents
(introductory, intermediate, or advanced), and a statement motivating
