    ===============================================================================
		  11th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on
		 Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design
				    (FARM)
		       Seattle, USA, 8th September 2023

    ===============================================================================

    The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
    Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
    functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

    Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
    development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
    growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
    art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
    techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
    these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
    greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

    FARM 2023 will feature an afternoon session of demos, and an evening
    session with a keynote and live performances.
