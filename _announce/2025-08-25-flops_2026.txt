## 18th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming
## May 26-28, 2026, Akita, Japan

FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and implementers
of declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and
common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language
systems and tools, and applications of these systems in practice. The
scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,
applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming.
FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory
and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.

Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan Village
(1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo (2001), Aizu (2002), Nara
(2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise (2008), Sendai (2010), Kobe (2012),
Kanazawa (2014), Kochi (2016), Nagoya (2018), Akita (2020, online),
Kyoto (2022, online), and Kumamoto (2024).

## Scope

FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:

* functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems,
formal methods and model checking, program transformations and program
refinements;

* developing programs with the help of theorem provers or
SAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using declarative
programming techniques, or statistical methods including generative
AI (*);

* foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation
techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications and
case studies.

FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative
programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be
understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and
researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its
contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying
what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its
area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system
descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.

(*) Note that FLOPS is a Programming Languages conference.
Submissions should be accessible to a Programming Languages audience.
The Program Committee has been selected from that audience, and it
may be unable to gauge the quality of your submission if that requires
specialized competencies in statistical methods and/or AI.  Special
attention should also be paid to the reproducibility of the results
from public sources.


## Submission

Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:

* Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be
judged on originality, correctness, and significance.

* System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be
judged on originality, usefulness, and design.

* Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories
with illustrative applications.

System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as
such in the title.

Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Authors must follow
[Springer’s Code of
Conduct](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct). See
also the
[ACM SIGPLAN Republication
Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication).
At least one author of each accepted paper should plan to
attend the conference in person to present the work: there will be no
general facility for online or pre-recorded presentation (but we will
do our best to accommodate visa issues and similar unavoidable
obstacles).

Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages
excluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are
typically shorter. The formatting has to conform to
[Springer’s
guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
Regular research papers should be supported by proofs
and/or experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting
information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to a
web page or an appendix, which does not count towards the
page limit). However, it is the responsibility of the authors to
guarantee that their paper can be understood and appreciated without
referring to this supporting information; reviewers may simply choose
not to look at it when writing their review.

Papers should be submitted electronically at:
https://meteor.springer.com/FLOPS2026

## Publication

The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. We
expect to invite the authors of a selection of the best papers to submit
an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will
appear in [Science of Computer Programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming).

## Important Dates

All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12).
