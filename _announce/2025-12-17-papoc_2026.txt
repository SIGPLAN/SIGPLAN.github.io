# Call for Papers

Consistency is one of the fundamental issues of distributed computing.
Beyond the well-known tension between Consistency, Availability, and
Partition-tolerance, as captured by the CAP theorem, many nuanced
consistency models and algorithms have been developed for different
purposes.  These consistency models have subtly different behaviour in
practice, which translates to difficult choices between fault
tolerance, performance, and programmability.  The issues and
trade-offs are particularly vexing at scale, with a large number of
processes or large shared databases, and in the presence of high
latency and failure-prone networks, such as edge computing and
peer-to-peer networks.

Since its inception in 2014, the PaPoC workshop series has brought
together researchers and practitioners who seek to develop better
techniques and a better understanding of consistency in distributed
systems.  We welcome contributions from a wide range of backgrounds:
system development, distributed algorithms, concurrency, fault
tolerance, databases, programming languages, blockchain, and
verification.  While there is no one universally best solution, we
believe that by bringing together these perspectives, we can develop
techniques that provide useful guarantees to applications, that are
usable by application developers, and that satisfy real-world
scalability, performance, and reliability requirements.

The workshop is looking for contributions on the following, and
associated, topics:

* Techniques for scaling and improving the performance of strongly
  consistent systems (e.g., Paxos-like algorithms, state-machine
  replication protocols and distributed transactional systems).

* Techniques for weak and hybrid consistency (such as session
  guarantees, causal consistency, operational transformation,
  conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), invariant-preserving
  replicated data types, monotonic programming, state merging,
  operation commutativity, etc).

* Data consistency in geo-replicated, peer-to-peer, and edge computing
  systems.

* How to expose consistency vs. performance and scalability trade-offs
  in the programming model, and how to help developers choose.

* How to support composed operations spanning multiple objects
  (transactions, sagas, workflows).

* Techniques or tools to aid the development of replicated data (e.g.,
  reasoning, analysis and verification of application programs using
  storage systems with various consistency models, visualization
  techniques for distributed dependencies or state merges, etc.).

* Formal methods for distributed systems dealing with strong/weak
  consistent data (such as techniques for verifying safety, liveness
  or consistency properties, convergence verification, etc.) 

* Implementation techniques and optimisations for replicated data
  types to improve fault tolerance, security, application-level
  invariants, metadata usage, and controlling divergence.

* Studies of performance, scalability, and programmability for the
  aforementioned systems.


## Details on submissions

The PaPoC workshop invites three types of submissions: 

* Short papers (up to 6 pages excluding bibliography) with original
  contributions, experience reports, or work-in-progress reports
  (supported by initial validations); 

* Full papers (up to 12 pages excluding bibliography) which may be
  concurrently submitted (or accepted) to other venues and do not have
  the option to be published in the ACM Digital Library;

* Lightning-talk abstracts, summarized in a maximum of 300 words,
  reporting preliminary ideas, new trends, recent experience, or
  ongoing results.

Submissions do not need to be (but are allowed to be) anonymised.

Papers and abstracts will be distributed to the participants of the
workshop. Authors of accepted **short papers** will have the
opportunity to choose whether they want their papers published in ACM
Digital Library (along with papers from other EuroSys workshops).
Lightning talk abstracts and full papers will not be included in the
ACM Digital Library.

At least one author of each accepted submission is expected to present
their work at the workshop and to be available for discussions.

## How to submit your work

Submissions should be made via HotCRP at: https://papoc26.hotcrp.com

All submissions should be written in English and provided in PDF
format.  We suggest that you use the ACM template for LaTeX or MS
Word, but this is not required.

If using the LaTeX template, use the `acmart` document class with the
`sigplan` and `twocolumn` options. To anonymize your submission, just
pass the `anonymous` option to `acmart.cls`. Finally, the `review`
option will add line numbers, which will make it easier for reviewers
to refer to specific parts of the paper.

For example, for an anonymized submission, one could use the following
LaTeX commands:

```
\documentclass[sigplan,twocolumn,review,anonymous]{acmart}
\renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}
\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printacmref=false}
```

In case of any questions, please contact the Program Chairs.
