# Call for Nominations: Editor-In-Chief, ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems

The term of the current Editor-in-Chief (EiC) of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS) <https://dl.acm.org/journal/tecs> is coming to an end, and the ACM Publications Board has set up a nominating committee to assist the Board in selecting the next EiC. TECS forms an archival source for publishing high-quality research and developmental results referring to analysis, design, behavior, and experience with embedded computing systems.

The subjects of emphasis are embedded perspectives on: system-level modeling, specification, and synthesis; hardware/software codesign; real-time systems; validation verification; fault tolerance, robustness, reliability and dependability; security and privacy. The scope of TECS also includes emerging technologies, embedded devices and networks for Internet of Things and edge computing, e.g., edge AI and embedded system architectures for TinyML.

Nominations, including self-nominations, are invited for a three-year term as TECS EiC, beginning on April 1, 2026. The EiC appointment may be renewed at most one time. This is a voluntary position, but ACM will provide appropriate administrative support.

Appointed by the ACM Publications Board, Editors-in-Chief (EiCs) of ACM journals are delegated full responsibility for the journal’s editorial management consistent with the journal's charter and general ACM policies. The Board relies on EiCs to ensure that the journal’s content is of high quality and that the editorial review process is both timely and fair. They have the final say on the acceptance of papers, the Editorial Board size, and Associate Editors' appointment. The ACM Volunteer Editors Position Description <https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/position-descriptions> contains a complete list of responsibilities. Self-nominations are encouraged and should include a CV and a statement of the candidate's vision for the future development of TECS.

The deadline for submitting nominations is January 15, 2026, although nominations will continue to be accepted until the position is filled. Please send all nominations to the search committee chair, Krishnendu Chakrabarty (krishnendu.chakrabarty@asu.edu). The search committee members are:

* Krishnendu Chakrabarty (Arizona State University), Chair
* Partha Pratim Pande (Washington State University)
* Preeti Ranjan Panda (Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi)
* Wei Zhang (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)
* Sebastian Steinhorst (Technical University of Munich)

The ACM Publications Board Liaison is: Sartaj Sahni (University of Florida)
