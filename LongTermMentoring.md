The SIGPLAN Long-Term Mentoring Committee (SIGPLAN-M) organizes an international long-term mentoring program for programming languages researchers.
The goal of the program is to address two mentoring needs in the programming languages community:

1. For aspiring or junior researchers, it is difficult---but necessary---to form long-term connections in the programming languages community,
and to access the perspectives of researchers from other institutions.
2. For senior researchers, it is difficult to access mentorship of any kind.

In response to these needs, SIGPLAN-M matches mentors with mentees from different institutions
for mentoring relationships that last at least a year.
As of May 2024, there are about 350 mentees and 250 mentors participating in the program.
Here are some testimonials from mentees:

> [SIGPLAN-M is] a career saver!

> [My mentor] is incredible AND the only person I talk to regularly who has an interest in the same topics that I do. Talking with [my mentor] gives me a sense of community that I hadn't had before.

> [SIGPLAN-M] was life changing.

> I wouldn't be able to obtain technical feedback for my work if SIGPLAN-M did not exist.

> Just talking to [my mentor] is incredibly validating. [My mentor's] support means the world to me.

> My mentor is amazing... Also, they made me think differently (in a positive way) about Academia and made me want to stay :).

> I had no idea what I was doing before, but now I have a pretty good idea of what to work on and a better sense of if I'm doing the right things/enough for grad school applications.

> I got help in all aspects - from research to getting through [a] graduate program.

## Getting Involved

We welcome aspiring and current programming languages researchers from all walks of life to serve as mentors, mentees, or both.
SIGPLAN members and non-members alike are welcome, and there is no cost to participate.
There are no limitations on country of residence or languages spoken.

Please see our [mentoring guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqY4msyoLNr-tOclwdfNTYVprgGOG0N5UGC48t2_6V8/edit?usp=sharing) for more information
on what the mentoring relationships look like, what sort of commitment is involved, and what other resources might be useful for mentors and mentees.

### Becoming a Mentor

We are always recruiting new mentors!
Graduate students, postdocs, industrial researchers, and faculty all make great mentors.
Please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN6M66lJTfKShaJ_OBhAFDHOZpDnYGixcXzhqn7UG1qcr6qg/viewform) if you are interested in serving as a mentor.

### Becoming a Mentee

We typically recruit and match new mentees in waves leading up to the POPL, PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH conferences.
You may sign up at any time using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegCRALo-2R9bBv_8c0NKeIytO90TWvQtbVcNOD7Ch8edaubw/viewform).

When there are more mentees than open spots, we maintain a waitlist and match as mentors become available.
In matching from the waitlist, we prioritize PLMW attendees, members of marginalized groups,
aspiring or junior researchers with little access to the programming languages community, and anyone who has an urgent need for mentoring.

Examples of urgent needs for mentoring include but are not limited to
mental health struggles, advisor-advisee conflicts, ongoing job or graduate school applications, and abusive situations at work or in the community.
If any of these apply, and if you are comfortable doing so, please feel free to contact us so that we match you in a timely fashion.
