#### Advisory Board

The role of the advisory board is to guide and support the work of the
editorial board and to provide institutional memory. The advisory
board will consist of the following members:

- Chair of SIGPLAN
- Vice-Chair of SIGPLAN
- Past Chair of SIGPLAN
- One representative from each of the participating conferences&#39; Steering Committees
- One member-at-large appointed by the ACM Publications Board

The SIGPLAN representatives serve for the same amount of time as their
roles in SIGPLAN: three years. The representatives of the conferences
Steering Committees and members-at-large will also serve for three
years.

#### Editorial Board

The role of the [Editorial Board](/PACMPL/Editors.md) is to run the day-to-day operations of
the journal. The editorial board will consist of (where _N_ is the
number of participating conferences):

- Editor-in-Chief: responsible for making sure the Journal information
  is always up-to-date, for coordination of the Editorial Board, for
  ensuring that the conferences conform to the editorial policies of
  the PACM series, and for planning longer-term editorial
  strategies. The Editor-in-Chief works directly with all the editors
  and advisors for proper operation of the journal, but does not play
  a direct role in paper selection. The Editor-in-Chief is appointed
  by the PACM Steering Committee in consultation with the
  journal&#39;s Advisory Board.
- _N_ Associate Editors: current Program Committee Chairs, responsible
  for paper reviews and selection. The Associate Editors (aka Program
  Chairs) will continue to be selected by the conferences&#39;
  Steering Committees.
- _N_ Senior Editors: Associate Editors of the previous year,
  responsible for supporting the current Associate Editors
- _N_ Assistant Editors: Program Committee Chairs of the following
  year, responsible for assisting the Associate Editors.

The Editor-in-Chief serves for a period of three years. All others
have a tenure of one year in their roles. Roll-off dates from one role
to another are the last days of the conferences.
