                  <p>TidalCycles is a library for live-coded music performance based in Haskell, and Strudel
                     is an adaptation of TidalCycles in JavaScript. Both have seen wide use, but their
                     implementation within existing environments for evaluating code limits the ways in
                     which a live code editor can integrate with the compilation process. This demo presents
                     Weft, a web-based Haskell-like interpreter which allows performers to use TidalCycles
                     syntax and type definitions to control Strudel's library of JavaScript pattern functions.
                     By implementing the parser, type checker, and runtime in a JavaScript module, Weft
                     enables interactive use in the browser, while also adding type inference and error
                     reporting rarely seen in web-based live coding environments.</p>

                  <p>Rocq N’Roll is a software instrument and tool with type proof -&gt; music. It parses
                     Rocq proof tactics into <em>Musical Instrument Digital Interface</em> (MIDI) notes to generate musical sound based on a proof state. ’Playing’ or ’performing’
                     a proof with Rocq N’Roll means stepping through it interactively to generate pitches
                     that correspond to the step in the proof, with more complex chords and melodies coming
                     from proof steps with multiple suboperations (i.e. automated tactics). Rocq N’ Roll
                     is primarily an artistic tool, but it may also have interesting use cases in helping
                     Rocq users conceptualize proof deautomation. And (in our humble opinion) it sounds
                     pretty sweet.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces an algorithmic performance approach for transforming real-time
                     environmental data into collaborative, generative sound practices. Drawing from atmospheric
                     and geospatial parameters — including temperature, humidity, and pollution indices
                     — the system generates both electronic soundscapes and adaptive notations for acoustic
                     performers. Through live navigation across global environmental conditions, the framework
                     explores dynamic, location-specific harmonic structures, integrating cultural and
                     ecological dimensions into the compositional process. By combining real-time data
                     acquisition, functional programming techniques, and algorithmic composition, the system
                     establishes a dialogic relationship between computational processes and human performers.
                     Departing from traditional sonification models based on symbolic or analytical mappings,
                     this approach frames live performance as a hybrid artistic space where environmental
                     data actively shape musical expression and audience experience. The work aims to position
                     environmental sonification within the broader context of generative art and real-time
                     algorithmic performance, fostering new modes of artistic and ecological engagement.</p>

                     to create various domain-specific languages. In particular, we provide two specializations
                     of our language: the first one produces Bézier paths and the second one combines and
                     manipulates these paths for vector graphics. Additionally, we introduce a syntax that

                  <p>Embedded music programming languages confer a number of benefits to composers by 
                     
                     bringing music objects into the world of modules, bindings, and code reuse.  
                     However, many composers write music in graphical score editors. A natural  
                     desire, then, would be to embed music languages into these editors. A  
                     proper embedding would provide a means to export the score-with-embedded-code  
                     from the score editor to a program in the music language's host language.  
                     This program ought to be loadable into a larger program context,  
                     leveraging the modular features of the host language to share bindings with  
                     other host language modules.

                     principles can be applied in other score editors, or with other choices of music 
                     
                     and host language.</p>
