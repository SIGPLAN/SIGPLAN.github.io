                  <p>Copatterns give functional programs a flexible mechanism for responding to their context,
                     and composition can greatly enhance their expressiveness. However, that same expressive
                     power makes it harder to precisely specify the behavior of programs. Using Danvy's
                     functional and syntactic correspondence between different semantic artifacts, we derive
                     a full suite of semantics for copatterns, twice. First, a calculus of monolithic copatterns
                     is taken on a journey from small-step operational semantics to abstract machine to
                     continuation-passing style. Then within continuation-passing style, we refactor the
                     semantics to derive a more general calculus of compositional copatterns, and take
                     the return journey back to derive the other semantic artifacts in reverse order.</p>

                  <p>Danvy introduced the concept of "mystery functions''  
                     as a way to teach multiple programming-related concepts  
                     that are often treated separately in common  
                     computer science curricula, in particular,  
                     specification, implementation, testing, recursion and induction.  
                     He presented concepts using the Rocq Prover.  
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     As part of a course on software correctness,  
                     we have recast Danvy's pedagogical themes  
                     using Slang, a verification-enabled subset of the Scala programming language,  
                     and its companion verification tool Logika.  
                     Together, Slang and Logika allow developers to program  
                     in a rich programming language and apply a variety of  
                     specification and verification techniques,  
                     all phrased in directly in  
                     Scala/Slang syntax that is easily accessible to programmers.  
                     This synergistic combination of programming and proof features enables  
                     us to convincingly encourage students with the mantras that "doing proofs is  
                     programming'' (and vice versa).  
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     As we teach concepts using Danvy's "mystery function''  
                     with Slang/Logika in a full programming language that blends programs  
                     and proofs, we add another dimension to the students' learning.  
                     In this paper, we describe mystery functions in Slang and demonstrate  
                     the advances we have made in teaching the above-mentioned concepts  
                     in programming classes.</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates algebraic effects and handlers from the  
                     viewpoint of well-established work on the four delimited continuation  
                     constructs known as shift, control, shift0, and control0.  
                     The whole development follows what Danvy and his colleagues have laid  
                     out.  
                     We start by defining two definitional interpreters for algebraic  
                     effects and handlers based on trails as introduced for dynamic  
                     continuation-passing style translation and metacontinuations as  
                     introduced for a hierarchy of control operators.  
                     Once definitional interpreters are obtained, we transform them  
                     using well-known meaning-preserving program translations to obtain  
                     abstract machines for algebraic effects and handlers.  
                     We also derive monomorphic type systems for algebraic effects and  
                     handlers by assigning types to the definitional interpreters,  
                     ones similar in spirit to the type system for shift and reset with  
                     answer type modification.  
                     The resulting semantic artifacts are close to those for delimited  
                     continuation constructs, enabling cross-fertilization between  
                     delimited continuation constructs and algebraic effects and handlers.</p>

                  <p>Simple closure analysis (SCA) distills the essence of the machinery underlying guaranteed
                     (near-)linear time constraint-based program analyses that emerged in the early 1990s.
                     It involves three key steps. First, reduction to a constraint problem that captures
                     abstract value flow in higher-order programming languages. Second, constraint normalization
                     by instrumented unification closure. Finally, interpretation of the normalized constraints
                     in the program analysis problem at hand.  
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     In the present paper we revisit SCA and explain its original rationale of combining
                     excellent asymptotic and practical run-time efficiency with guaranteed semantic robustness
                     properties. We point out that SCA models induced flows bidirectionally, but keeps
                     directional surface flow information. This preserves valuable directional flow information
                     while breaking through the inherent quasi-cubic complexity of full closure analysis
                     (0CFA), in which also induced flows are directional. We review some of the subsequent
                     applications, extensions, and results on semantic robustness of SCA. We suggest that
                     its modularity and the efficiency of its core data structure, a contracted and closed
                     flow graph on abstract closures and structured data, be kept in mind for algorithmically
                     efficient and semantically robust program analyses on large code bases.

                     This paper contains the original technical report on Simple Closure Analysis, with
                     a few typographical changes and added explanations for clarification. It was posted
                     on an FTP server at DIKU in 1992 and influenced several subsequent works, but was
                     never submitted for publication (until now). It is a (very) late response to Olivier

                     my heartfelt thanks for his encouragement.</p>

                  <p>This study addresses the problem of detecting redundant assertions in reversible programs.
                     We investigate an interpretive method for the automatic verification of assertion
                     redundancy by checking satisfiability of Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs), a fragment
                     of first-order logic. By formalizing a transition semantics of reversible flowcharts
                     in CHC and using well-known examples, including Dijkstraâ€™s permutation-to-code algorithm,
                     we show that standard techniques and tools developed in the field of CHC-based verification
                     appear suitable for addressing this unconventional optimization problem. The scalability
                     of the approach may be achieved through techniques such as CHC specialization and
                     abstract interpretation.</p>

                  <p>Static analysis aims at computing semantic properties of programs. Abstract interpretation
                     provides a framework to design static analyses and allows one to divide the construction
                     of a static analysis into the definition of abstract domains that describe families
                     of logical predicates with operations to reason on them, and the semantic-guided formalisation
                     of abstract interpreters. The latter relies on the abstract domains, that describe
                     semantic properties, and on the concrete semantics. A large part of the research on
                     static analysis focuses on the design of novel abstract domains, with ever more expressive
                     and/or efficient computer representation for semantic properties. In this short paper,
                     we consider more specifically the core of the abstract interpreters (also called the
                     abstract iterators) and discuss several techniques to build them, that are inspired
                     by functional programming. First, we briefly discuss common iteration techniques based
                     on control flow graphs, which have often been used for program analyses aimed at computing
                     state properties. Second, we consider iteration techniques that borrow principles
                     from denotational semantics and are typically defined by induction over the syntax
                     of programs. Last, we extend the latter family of techniques to relational abstractions
                     that capture relations between program inputs and outputs.</p>

                  <p>The Scheme programming language was introduced in 1975 as a lexically-scoped dialect
                     of Lisp. It has subsequently been improved and extended through many rounds of standardization,
                     documented by the Scheme Reports. </p>
                  <p>In Lisp, eval is a function taking a single argument; when the value of the argument
                     represents an expression, eval proceeds to evaluate it in the current environment.
                     The Scheme procedure eval is similar, but takes an extra argument that determines
                     the evaluation environment. </p>
                  <p>The so-called classic standards for Scheme and its latest modern standard all include
                     a denotational semantics of core expressions and of some required procedures. However,
                     the semantics does not cover eval. When Muchnick and Pleban compared the denotational
                     semantics of Lisp and Scheme in 1980, they wrote that it was not possible to give
                     a structural semantics of eval expressions. Similarly, in 1984, Clinger pointed out
                     that the semantics of eval violates compositionality; he suggested to define eval
                     using a non-compositional copy of the semantic function. </p>
                  <p>This paper adapts Clingerâ€™s suggestion by letting the semantic function take an extra
                     argument, then defining that argument by an explicit fixed point. The resulting semantics
                     of eval expressions is fully compositional. The wellformedness of the semantics has
                     been tested using a lightweight Agda formalization; verifying that the denotations
                     have expected properties is work in progress.</p>

                     Recent work has resurrected the interest in second class values as they allow us 
                     
                     to safely allocate some data structures (e.g., closures) on the run-time stack.  
                     This approach has the advantage of avoiding the cost and the  
                     unpredictable timing of garbage collection for  
                     these structures as their deallocation takes no extra time when the  
                     stack is popped.  
                     A system with qualified types ensures that second class values do not

                  <p>While syntactic logical relations have been defined and applied primarily for calculi
                     with types, it has been occasionally demonstrated that the technique can be employed
                     in an untyped context as well, by replacing the type structure with step-indexing.
                     In this article, we show how untyped step-indexed logical relations can be used both
                     to prove contextual equivalence of expressions within a single calculus and to establish
                     strong properties of program translations from one calculus to another. </p>
                  <p>To this end, we focus on the untyped call-by-value Î»-calculus extended with the standard
                     abortive control operators call/cc and abort, for which we define biorthogonal step-indexed
                     binary logical relations. In contrast to the existing untyped logical relations, which
                     are defined intensionally, i.e., based on constructors, our definition is extensional,
                     i.e., based on eliminators. Such an approach scales better to richer languages, but
                     it poses certain technical challenges that we show how to overcome. Using these relations
                     we verify some interesting program equivalences, one of which is known to be hard
                     to prove with the existing techniques such as bisimulations. We then define untyped
                     inter-language logical relations in order to present an elegant proof of the full
                     abstraction theorem for a standard CPS translation from the calculus with control
                     operators to (a fragment of) the pure Î»-calculus.</p>

                  <p>One way to ascertain the quality of the generated code -- its  
                     performance, hygiene, memory safety, deadlock freedom, etc. -- is to  
                     decorate it with annotations that explicate some aspect of the code:  
                     e.g., the count of particular operations, its free variables, the  
                     sequence of IO or memory allocation operations, correctness proof  
                     obligations. The annotations are built along with generating  
                     the code, and may be used to detect problems like scope  
                     extrusion or deadlock -- well before the whole program is  
                     generated, let alone executed. Annotations are a worthy  
                     alternative to fancy types.

                     Generating code along with annotations is almost straightforward. The  
                     challenge comes from generating functions or other variable-binding  
                     forms, with the often used so-called higher-order abstract syntax  
                     (HOAS). That was the challenge posed by Olivier Danvy.

                     The present paper describes a new, simpler and general solution of the  
                     challenge -- actually, of its general form: pairing of  
                     HOAS generators, or direct product of algebra-like structures with HOAS  
                     operations. The solution also overcomes the hitherto unsolved HOAS problem:

                  <p>Techniques for implementing a call-by-value Î»-calculus are well known,  
                     including Reynolds's definitional interpreter and  
                     techniques that Danvy developed for moving between  
                     reduction rules and abstract machines. Most techniques focus  
                     on ensuring that an implementation produces the same evaluation result  
                     as a model, but time and space properties are also within reach.  
                     Proper tail-call handling falls out of Reynolds's approach,  
                     for example, but the stronger property of space safety is less readily  
                     available, particularly if  
                     worst-case time complexity matters. In this paper, we explore  
                     an approach to space safety that is realized through the garbage  
                     collector, instead of the interpreter loop, in the hope of finding a  
                     convenient implementation technique that matches the asymptotic time  
                     bounds of fast evaluation models and the asymptotic space bounds of  
                     compact evaluation models. We arrive within a size-of-source factor of  
                     achieving those bounds. Our implementation technique is comparable in  
                     complexity to some other interpreter variants; specifically, it requires  
                     some library functions for binary trees, specialized environment  
                     traversals in the garbage collector, and a compilation pass to gather  
                     the free variables of each expression and to rewrite each variable  
                     reference to its binding depth.</p>

                  <p>Defunctionalization, a process to transform higher-order programs into first-order
                     ones, has been heavily studied for its structure, its use-cases, its logical semantics,
                     etc. This extended abstract is an invitation to study defunctionalization through
                     the prism of a shallow embedding in an interactive theorem prover. We use metaprogramming
                     techniques to automatize program transformation and proof generation, with a starting
                     implementation in Rocq. The long term goals are to define defunctionalization for
                     a large subset of Type Theory, to prove and generate proofs such as semantics and
                     termination preservation, and more generally to use metaprogramming with strong guaranties
                     to have a better understanding of this program transformation.</p>

                  <p>In the seminal paper Functional unparsing, Olivier Danvy used  
                     continuation passing to reanalyse printf-like format strings as  
                     combinators. In the intervening decades, the conversation shifted  
                     towards a concurrent line of work --- applicative, monadic or  
                     arrow-based combinator libraries --- in an effort to find combinators  
                     for invertible syntax descriptions that  
                     simultaneously determine a parser as well  
                     as a printer, and with more expressive power, able to handle  
                     inductive structures such as lists and trees. Along the way,  
                     continuation passing got lost. This paper argues that Danvy's  
                     insight remains as relevant to the general setting as it was to the  
                     restricted setting of his original paper. Like him, we present three  
                     solutions that exploit continuation-passing style as an alternative  
                     to both dependent types and monoidal aggregation via nested pairs,  
                     in our case to parse and print structured data with increasing  
                     expressive power.</p>

                  <p>We present a simulation of quantum systems where the state vectors and observables
                     are polymorphic Haskell functions. The model is not restricted to qubits: It admits
                     state spaces of infinite dimension, but with finite number of degrees of freedom.
                     (So, the subject is quantum mechanics and not quantum field theory).  
                     Since the state vectors and operators are not represented or manipulated as symbolic
                     formulae, they are opaque as all functions in Haskell, and they cannot be treated
                     as classical data. In order to unveil their contents, they can only be applied.  
                     	  
                     We expect from the reader a moderate familiarity with elementary quantum theory, but
                     the part about quantum computing is kept at a basic level.
