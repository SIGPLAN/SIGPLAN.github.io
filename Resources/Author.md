title: "Author Information for SIGPLAN Conferences"
---
SIGPLAN commissioned the construction of a LaTeX class file for
SIGPLAN conference papers. You will need the class file, the
document template, and the guide. The template produces your paper
in 9-point type, but contains simple options that you can use to
obtain 10- and 11-point type. Your conference will specify which
size is required; 9-point is the usual choice.

Please include the 'preprint' option on the \documentclass command
until you submit your paper for publication. The page numbers it
produces are of great help to reviewers. The document template
includes the 'preprint' option.

-   [guide](http://drupal.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/sigplanconf-guide.pdf)


*ICFP 2013 Authors: the sigplanconf-guide.pdf is out of date regarding permission and copyright notices.
Can ICFP 2013 authors instead refer to the template and the instructions they have received from Sheridan.
We will update the sigplanconf-guide.pdf shortly.*

Please address questions and problems with the class file to sigplan-class at acm dot org.

There is a [Word template](http://drupal.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/sigplanconf.dot) that attempts to
emulate the Latex class file; many thanks to Friedrich Steimann for
producing this. There is also a
[Word template](http://drupal.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/sigplanconf-varsize.dot) that provides support for
different point sizes (this template was commissioned by OOPSLA and
is being used for OOPSLA and Splash!). Please address questions and
problems with the Word template to steimann@acm.org.  
(ACM's site contains an older
[Word template](http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/pubform.doc).)
