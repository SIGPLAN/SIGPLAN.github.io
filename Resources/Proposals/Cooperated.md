title: "SIGPLAN In-Cooperation Proposal"
---
Executive Summary
-----------------

Events organized in cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN benefit from
SIGPLAN's name and oversight, and from publicity disseminated to
SIGPLAN members. There is a lightweight application process, and there
are no financial implications.  

Rationale
---------

As part of its activities, ACM SIGPLAN has two types of relationship
with conferences and workshops: *sponsorship* and *in-cooperation*. The
primary difference between the two is that SIGPLAN takes a more
hands-off approach to in-cooperation events than to the ones it
sponsors, and in particular does not take financial responsibility for
them. This page describes in-cooperation status; a separate page describes
[sponsored status](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Proposals/Sponsored).  

Benefits
--------

In-cooperation status provides a number of benefits:

- You can use the phrase "in cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN" on any
  publicity about the event.
- Announcements about the meeting can be disseminated via
  SIGPLAN's mailing list. (Contact
  [infodir\_sigplan@acm.org](mailto:infodir_sigplan@acm.org?subject=SIGPLAN%20Mailing%20List).)
- You will get entries in the _Call for Papers_
  and _Professional Calendar_ sections of _Communications of the ACM_, free of charge.
- You can also buy an advert in _CACM_ at a special rate. All placement
  of such adverts should be arranged through ACM Headquarters. Please
  check CACM as to the lead time required. Discounts on ACM mailing
  lists are also available.
- You will also have space reserved in _SIGPLAN Notices_ for the final report
  summarizing the meeting.

Responsibilities
----------------

The requirements for SIGPLAN in-cooperation status
include the following:

- The event must have an open call for participation and a clearly
  documented evaluation and review process.
- The meeting cannot be sponsored by a for-profit organization;
  however, some forms of corporate funding are allowed.
  (SIGPLAN is not financially responsible for the meeting.)
- Registration costs should be reasonable; if there is a reduced
  registration rate, then SIGPLAN members should be eligible for it.

In-cooperation events are encouraged to follow
SIGPLAN policies and procedures, including the following:

- [Diversity Policy](/Resources/Policies/Diversity)
- [Conference Submission Review Policy](/Resources/Policies/Review)
- [Republication Policy](/Resources/Policies/Republication)
- [Guidelines for Steering Committee Formation/Management](/Resources/Guidelines/SCommittee)
- [Guidelines for the General Chair](/Resources/Guidelines/GenChair)
- [Guidelines for the Program Chair](/Resources/Guidelines/ProChair)
- [Code of Conduct Policy](/Resources/Policies/CodeOfConduct/)

In addition, event organizers are encouraged to contact the ACM
Headquarters ([incoop@acm.org](mailto:incoop@acm.org)), to have
SIGPLAN membership materials sent directly to the conference
location for display there.   

How to Apply
------------
  
To attain SIGPLAN in-cooperation status, you need SIGPLAN to endorse your proposal.
To achieve this, send a request to the
[SIGPLAN Vice Chair](mailto:vc_sigplan@acm.org),
preferably at least **twelve months before** the event. The
description should include the following information, **in plain text** (not PDF or Word, please):

1.  Focus of the meeting and intended audience.
2.  Time frame and place.
3.  Sponsoring organization (an entity that is taking fiscal and
    legal responsibility for the conference).
4.  Plans for publicity, and details of the publication process.
5.  Proposed organization.
6.  Plans for the call for participation for the meeting.
7.  Submission review process, including size and expected
    composition of the program committee.
8.  Name and email addresses of the organizers.
9.  Relevant information about any previous meeting,
    such as attendance, site, budget, and registration fees
    (if applicable).
10. URL of the meeting information page.

What Happens Next
-----------------

The request will be considered by the
[SIGPLAN Executive Committee](/ContactUs). 
A response to the request is usually given within two weeks. 
The Executive Committee can only endorse the request; you still need to apply
for ACM approval. Your event will not receive SIGPLAN in-cooperation
status or be included on the ACM calendar until this step is completed
with ACM. To do this, please read ACM's _In Cooperation Event TMRF
Guidelines_, then submit for ACM approval the online _In Coop TMRF_;
both of these are accessible from the [ACM Conference
Manual](http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/incoop).

ACM will inform you of their official approval decision within 
two weeks of receiving this information.
If you have questions, contact the ACM ([incoop@acm.org](mailto:incoop@acm.org)).
