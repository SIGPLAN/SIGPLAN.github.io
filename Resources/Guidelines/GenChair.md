Executive Summary
-----------------

You may be an experienced conference organizer, in which case much of
the advice on this page may already be familiar to you. Nevertheless,
even experienced organizers sometimes forget some important points, so
please at least skim this page as well as the following ones:

- SIGPLAN's [conference policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w5T6bGmUO-8vjHSHpwegkpyFzYypi9HcheUxMTjo-Jw/edit?usp=sharing_)
- SIGPLAN's [conference submission review policy](/Resources/Policies/Review) 
- SIGPLAN's [diversity policy](/Resources/Policies/Diversity)
- ACM's [policy against harassment at ACM activities](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/conference-planning/opening-slide-on-acm-activities-policy)
- SIGPLAN's [Republication Policy](/Resources/Policies/Republication)
- SIGPLAN's [Code of Conduct Policy](/Resources/Policies/CodeOfConduct/)
- SIGACCESS's [Guide to Creating a Conference Accessibility FAQ Page](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/creating-a-conference-accessibility-faq-page/)
- if you plan to request in-cooperation or sponsored status, do so well in advance (twelve or eighteen months, respectively)
- seek approval for important roles (PC Chair, and for a sponsored event also PC members) from SIGPLAN Vice-Chair, *before* sending invitations
- consult with the conference Steering Committee before diverging from any existing conventions

_Please help us keep this document (and the rest of this site) up to date:_ If you notice any errors, duplications, inconsistencies, etc., please inform the [SIGPLAN vice chair](mailto:vc_sigplan@acm.org).

Program Chair
---------------

Select potential Program Chair(s) and send their names to the [SIGPLAN
Chair](mailto:chair_sigplan@acm.org)<!-- BCP: Most places, we do not ask
people to submit these to the SIGPLAN Chair, just the Vice Chair.  Just the
VC seems like the actual (and correct) practice. --> and
[Vice-Chair](mailto:vc_sigplan@acm.org) for approval. Do this _before_
asking the person to serve, 18 months prior to the event. Make sure the
Program Chair reviews SIGPLAN's [conference submission review
policy](/Resources/Policies/Review) and [diversity
policy](/Resources/Policies/Diversity).

Date and Location
-----------------

Select three potential sites for the conference and send them to the
ACM representative and the SIGPLAN Vice-Chair. If the event is part of
a series, then the date of the conference may have been
established by the time you agreed to serve as chair (two years prior
to the meeting). Please be careful about what information you provide
directly to hotels so as not to reduce ACM's negotiating
leverage.

Submission and Review Policies
------------------------------

The Program Chair may not submit papers to the conference, and the
SIGPLAN Executive Committee recommends that
the General Chair also not be allowed to submit papers. 
The conference steering committee should be consulted for any
changes to the accepted way of organizing and running the
conference. The SIGPLAN Executive Committee serves as the steering
committee for conferences without steering
committees of their own.

Approval and Call for Papers
----------------------------

<!--- (BCP) How does a GC know whether their conference is part of a series which already has approval for ongoing sponsorship?? --->

Develop a timeline, at least eighteen months in advance of the conference date.
Unless the conference is part of a series which already has approval
for ongoing sponsorship, submit to the SIGPLAN Vice-Chair a [SIGPLAN
sponsorship request form](/Resources/Proposals/Sponsored) eighteen months
before the date of the conference. If you are unsure as to whether you
need to submit a request form, ask the [SIGPLAN Vice
Chair](mailto:vc_sigplan@acm.org?subject=SIGPLAN%20Sponsorship).  An
ACM [preliminary approval
form](http://cms.acm.org/tmrf/cms_paf.cfm) (PAF)
must be submitted in order to issue a call for papers.  Approval of a
PAF also causes the conference to be added to ACM's master calendar.

Website
-------

Establish a web site for the conference and send the URL to the
SIGPLAN [Information
Director](mailto:infodir_sigplan@acm.org?subject=Conference%20Information)
(as soon as date and site are determined). You can put a preliminary
call on the web without listing the program committee, but a PAF
must have been approved.

Financial Support for Students
----------------------------------

The Professional Activities Committee of SIGPLAN has been established
to award [travel grants](/PAC) for students to present at
SIGPLAN-sponsored events. Please mention its availability on your web
page.  PAC also has supported programs for underrepresented
groups. If you would like to explore this possibility, please contact
the PAC chair, listed on the PAC web page.

Consider seeking NSF funding to support student participation too. If
you do so, do it well in advance, and consider specifying ACM as the
recipient of the funds, so that they can handle disbursement.

Organizational Team
-------------------

Select other members of the organizational team (e.g., local
arrangements chair, publicity chair, publications chair, tutorial
chair, etc). Send the names to the SIGPLAN Chair and Vice-Chair,
one year before the event.

<!--- (BCP) Do the chair and vice chair have to approve the names, or is this just FYI? (Or is this step needed at all?) --->

Local arrangements (such as registration and hotel management) for the
main SIGPLAN conferences PLDI, OOPSLA, POPL, and ICFP are usually
handled by a professional organization.

The conference steering committee should be consulted about any
changes to the accepted way of organizing and running the
conference.

Budget and Finances
-------------------

Complete the [TMRF budget
form](http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/sponstmrfpage).
The budget must include line items for [contingency and return-to-SIG
fees](/Resources/Guidelines/Budget).

SIGPLAN's general guideline is that the conference may offer
complimentary registration and travel/lodging for keynote speakers and
may offer complimentary registration for one tutorial speaker per
tutorial.

ACM handles the bank accounts for sponsored conferences. Send email to
the [ACM Representative to SIGPLAN](mailto:spinola@hq.acm.org?subject=Conference%20advance)
for an advance. Expenses for reimbursement should also be sent to
the
[ACM Representative to SIGPLAN](mailto:spinola@hq.acm.org?subject=Conference%20expenses).
Andrew Black wrote a [document](/sites/default/files/SIGPLAN_conference_finances_for_beginners.pdf)
after SPLASH 2014 explaining where the money was spent.

Program Committee
-------------------

Help the Program Chair to select the program committee. The list
of potential committee members has to be approved by the SIGPLAN Vice-Chair
(who will consult the whole SIGPLAN Executive Committee) before the members
are invited. You and the PC Chair 
should decide on policies for submission and revewing (see
[Guidelines for Program Committee Chair](/Resources/Guidelines/ProChair)).
Please use the [PC proposal
spreadsheet](/Resources/Guidelines/sigplan-pc-proposal-template.xlsx)
to expedite the approval process.

Satellite Events
----------------

Co-located conferences or workshops make your event more attractive to
participants.  Establish a deadline for submission of workshop
proposals. Consider appointing a workshop chair to coordinate them.  (Make
sure that whoever is handling this task -- whether you or a workshop chair
-- has a conversation early in the process with the [SIGPLAN Vice
Chair](mailto:vc_sigplan@acm.org?subject=Workshops) to get clear on
SIGPLAN's expectations for how workshop PCs are formed and vetted.)

You should contact chairs of co-located events and plan the common advance
program, joint technical sessions, joint social events, etc. You
should consider workshops on "hot" topics. Have the workshop chairs
submit a proposal to the SIGPLAN Vice-Chair, as specified in the
[In-Cooperation](/Resources/Proposals/Cooperated) or
[Sponsorship](/Resources/Proposals/Sponsored) 
web pages.

<!--- (BCP) This policy seems to be out of date... We do now give satellite -->
<!--- events a budget based on theri attendance. --->
SIGPLAN's general guideline is that the conference does not provide
additional funds to workshops to pay travel or registration costs for
workshop organizers, keynote speakers, or other dignitaries. This
guideline is not strict, and may be relaxed under certain
circumstances.

Preparing the Program
-----------------------

Once the conference program is set, work with the PC chair to prepare an advance program that
can be posted on the conference's web page. The advance program can
also be used to create a schedule of events to be
handed out at the on-site conference registration.  

Post-event Reporting
--------------------

<!--- (BCP) Does anybody actually do this?  Not much point in having a rule if it's universally ignored... --->

Send a report at the end of the conference to the SIGPLAN 
Vice-Chair. The report should include information about any
workshops that co-located with the conference. Please include:

-   number of attendees, broken down into categories (ACM
    members, students, SIGPLAN members),
-   number of papers and/or proposals submitted and the number
    accepted,
-   financial information,
-   general description of events that went well and those that did
    not, and
-   discussion of problems.
