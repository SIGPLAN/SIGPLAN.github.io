title: "Guidelines for the Steering Committee of a SIGPLAN Event"
---
All conference series that are sponsored by SIGPLAN must be organized by a
Steering Committee (SC). The SC, working in partnership
with the SIGPLAN Executive Committee (EC), is responsible for the
overall organization and financial plan of each conference
instance.

Responsibilities of the SC
--------------------------

1.  To appoint the conference General Chair and Program
    Chair, after approval by the EC Chair and Vice-Chair.
2.  To provide help and guidance to the General Chair in selecting
    the site and date and preparing the budget, in collaboration
    with SIGPLAN's liaison at ACM. Also to provide help and
    guidance with the overall technical organization of the
    conference.
3.  To request approval from the EC Chair and Vice-Chair
    whenever a major change is planned for the conference.
4.  To notify the EC Chair and Vice-Chair when the membership
    of the SC changes.
5.  To have a representative attend SIGPLAN EC
    meetings when issues relevant to the conference are under
    consideration.

Steering Committee Bylaws
-------------------------

The SC operates under a set of rules, which must be
established by the initial steering committee and approved by the
SIGPLAN EC. These rules must include the following:

1.  Composition of the SC: 
    the number of members serving, and the structure of the committee.
    (For example, the SC could be made up of the current
    and previous two General Chairs and Program Chairs.)
2.  Committee member rotation: how committee members are rotated 
    off the SC (how often, how many, and in
    what order).
3.  How the chair of the SC is determined.
4.  The schedule for the conference: how often and
    what time of year.
