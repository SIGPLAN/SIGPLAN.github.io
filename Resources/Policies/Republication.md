title: "SIGPLAN Republication Policy"
---
ACM's republication policy for journals is given in sections 6.2.2
and 6.2.3 of the conference manual
<http://www.acm.org/sig_volunteer_info/conference_manual/6-2-2REP.HTM>.
Revisions of conference papers may later appear in journal papers
if the editor determines there is significant additional benefit
from doing so.  

The SIGPLAN policy extends ACM's policy as follows:  

-   **Prior Journal Publication.** Papers that have appeared in a
    journal, or may appear in a journal before a conference or
    workshop, may not be submitted to the conference or workshop. If a
    paper is simultaneously submitted to a conference and a journal,
    the author must bring this fact to the attention of both the editor
    and program chair.
-   **Simultaneous Submissions.** If two or more papers are
    substantially the same, then they may not be simultaneously
    submitted to more than one conference or workshop. Authors should
    bring simultaneously submitted related papers to the attention of
    all relevant program chairs. If the program chairs deem the related
    papers to be simultaneous duplicate submissions, the authors should
    be asked to withdraw all but one of the submissions. If the degree
    of similarity is unclear, the program committees should evaluate
    the submissions on the assumption that all other simultaneous
    related submissions will be accepted.
-   **Prior Publication of Closely Related Work.** If a closely
    related paper was previously accepted at a conference or a workshop
    with proceedings of any kind, the original paper must be cited, its
    relationship to the current paper explained, and the program chair
    must be explicitly informed. The second paper will be judged on the
    additional value of its publication in the new venue. Such value
    might come from the wider audience for the new venue or from
    subjecting the work to a higher standard of review. Program
    committees should consider factors such as the following in
    deciding whether to publish the second paper:
    -   The call for papers for the first venue clearly states that
        publication in the venue is not intended to preclude later
        publication.
    -   The original proceedings are not easily accessible to the
        SIGPLAN community.
    -   The first venue targeted a geographically limited audience.


We foresee no circumstances under which an unrevised conference
paper will be accepted to a second conference.  

**Program Chair Discretion.**  
Program chairs may immediately reject
papers that they judge to be in violation of this policy.  

**Requests to authors**  
If you are ever in doubt about a particular case, please either
discuss it in advance with the program chair(s), or inform the
program chair(s) at the time of submission. Failure to do so risks
automatic rejection of all submissions.  

It is best practice for any paper to describe its relation to
earlier versions. Cite the related appearances or submissions, and
describe their relationship to the current paper. You might say
that the papers are substantially the same, or you might note how
previous papers differ from the current one.
