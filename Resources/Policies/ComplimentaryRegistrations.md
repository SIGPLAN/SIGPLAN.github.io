title: "SIGPLAN Conference Complimentary Registrations at Conferences Policy"
---

This policy applies to any events that are organized and financed by SIGPLAN (e.g. POPL, PLDI, ICFP, SPLASH/OOPSLA, as well as CC, PPoPP, SLE, GPCE, and the SIGPLAN-related CGO and ASPLOS components).

As a general rule of thumb, all the members of the organizing committee, including the General Chair and Review Committee Chair (or Chairs if there are two as is the case for OOPSLA), have to pay full registration for the conference. *The only exception can be made when they do not have the funding to attend the conference for which they are doing the work.*

In cases of insufficient funding, complimentary registration and, if needed, economy-class return airfare and hotel during the conference can be provided to ensure their attendance. This is up to the General Chair in consultation with the SIGPLAN Chair and Treasurer to approve.

Complimentary registrations and possible travel support for economy-class return airfare and hotel during the conference (if there is no funding) are thus allowed *only* for these roles:

   * Plenary keynote speakers for the main conference (typically at most 2 or 3 during a single event).
   * Student volunteer chair(s) (a maximum of 1 being the senior SV chair if there are two).
   * AV chair(s) (a maximum of 1 per conference to record keynotes only).

To reiterate, we hope that appropriate research funding or corporate funding can be used by the attendees’ host institution or organization to minimize the expenses.

Complimentary full registrations *only* (no travel or hotel support) may be allowed for these roles:

   * Sponsor-nominated attendee, as specified in the relevant bronze, silver, gold, or platinum sponsorship agreement in effect at the time the donation is committed.

Complimentary student registration *only* (no travel or hotel support) may be allowed for these roles:

   * Student volunteers with a limit set by the General Chair, aiming to have no more than one student volunteer per 2 days of the conference per parallel stream.

To clarify further:

   * Other events, such as workshops, do not receive complimentary registrations. If they want to fund registrations, they must seek their own sponsorship to do so outside of the conference budget.
   * All other organizing committee members are not currently provided with any funding from the conference budget.
   * No Steering Committee chairs or members can be funded out of conference budget.
