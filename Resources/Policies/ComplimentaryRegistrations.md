title: "SIGPLAN Conference Complimentary Registrations at Conferences Policy"
---

This policy applies to any events that are organised and financed by SIGPLAN (e.g. POPL, PLDI, ICFP, SPLASH/OOPSLA, as well as CC, PPoPP, and the SIGPLAN related CGO and ASPLOS components).

All the members of the organising committee including the General Chair and Review Committee Chair(s) have to pay full registration for the conference. The only exception can be made for the General Chair and for one of the Review Committee Chair is when they do not have funding to attend this conference. In such cases, a complimentary registration and if needs be economy class return airfar and hotel during the conference can be funded to ensure their presence during the event. This is up to the General Chair for the RC Chair and up to the SIGPLAN Chair or Treasurer for the GC to confirm/approve.

Complimentary registrations allowed *only* in these siutations:

   * Plenary keynote speakers for the main conference (typically at most 2 or 3 during a single event) as keynote speakers may also be covered for the economy class airfare and hotel, again we hope that appropriate research funding or corporate funding can be used by the keynote speaker host institution or organisation to minimise the expenses.
   * Student volunteers get one free student registration with a limit set by the General Chair aiming to have no more than one student volunteer per 2 days of the conference per parallel stream.
   * If explicitly approved by the SIGPLAN Chair or Treasurer.

Other events such as workshops do not receive complimentary registrations. If they want to fund registrations they must seek their own sponsorship to do so outside of the conference budget.

<!--
To clarify further:
   * All other organising committee members (e.g. AV chairs, SV chairs, etc) are not currently provided with any funding from the conference budget.
   * No Steering Committee chairs or members can be funded out of conference budget.
