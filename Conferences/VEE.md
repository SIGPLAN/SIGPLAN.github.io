title: "Virtual Execution Environments (VEE)"
---
The goal of Virtual Execution Environments is to be a first-rate
research forum that brings together leading practitioners and
researchers in the broad area of virtualization, which includes
topics such as high-level language virtual machines (JVM, CLR,
etc.), process and system virtual machines, translators, machine
emulators, and simulators.

**VEE Steering Committee Composition**

The VEE steering committee (SC) comprises past general
and program chairs and a USENIX representative, assuming USENIX
continues to co-sponsor the event.  
Membership on the steering committee will be updated as follows:

**Additions**

The general and program chair of the most recent
VEE conference will be invited to join the SC, if they are not
already members.

**Deletions**

When the conference has been held for a number of
years, members will be removed from the committee based on the date
of the last time they were general or program chair of VEE. 

The rotation of the SC membership occurs prior to the election of
the new SC chair each (see below).  
  
As long as USENIX remains a sponsor of VEE, there will remain a
USENIX representative on the SC.  This is an exception to the rules
above for rotating people off the committee.  
  
The chair of the steering committee is determined by a majority
vote of the steering committee members after each conference.  In
most years, we expect a new chair to be elected annually.  The
previous General Chair (or some other well-defined SC member)
becomes SC Chair until a new SC Chair is elected.
