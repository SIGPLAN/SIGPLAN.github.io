title: "Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR)"
---
MPLR is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).

**MPLR History**

MPLR commenced in 2002 as a Java-focused conference (Principles and Practice of Programming in Java, PPPJ). In 2017, the scope was broadened and the event was renamed to ManLang (Managed Languages and Runtimes). In 2019 it was again renamed to MPLR (Managed Programming Languages and Runtimes).
