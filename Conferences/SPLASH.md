---
SPLASH (Systems, Programming, Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity) contains several conferences concerned with programming, languages, and software engineering, including [OOPSLA](/Conferences/OOPSLA)  (Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications), [Onward!](/Conferences/Onward), [DLS](/Conferences/DLS) (the Dynamic Languages Symposium),  [GPCE](/Conferences/GPCE) (Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences), and [SLE](/Conferences/SLE) (Software Language Engineering).

**SPLASH Steering Committee**

The SPLASH Steering Committee is constituted by the following members:

-   current SIGPLAN Chair,
-   current SIGPLAN Vice Chair,
-   future, current, and *past three* SPLASH General Chairs,
-   future, current, and *past three* OOPSLA Program Chairs,
-   future, current, and *past one year's* Onward! Program Chairs (Papers and Essays)
-   Steering Committee Chair for Onward!
-   Steering Committee Chair for *any conference that co-located with SPLASH for the past three years*
-   the outgoing Chair of the Steering Committee, for one year past the end of their term as Chair.

*NB!* In 2026 the past three years are 2025, 2024, and 2023 and the co-located conferences include: SAS (while GPCE and SLE last co-located in 2023).

The Chair of the Steering Committee is elected by the Steering Committee from among the members of the committee to serve a two-year term. The Chair of the Steering Committee would normally also serve as the chair of the OOPSLA Steering Committee which is a subcommittee of the SPLASH SC. The outgoing chair serves an additional year on the committee past his or her term as chair to provide institutional memory.

Steering Committee membership was expanded by adding members-at-large in 2020, with the intention of adding one member-at-large each subsequent year.  Members-at-large serve 4 year terms and are selected by the Steering Committee.

The membership of the steering committee changes each year upon conclusion of that year's conference.

The current SPLASH steering committee is:
