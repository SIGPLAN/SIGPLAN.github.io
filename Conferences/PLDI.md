**Practices of PLDI**

The document [Practices of PLDI](http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/PracticesofPLDI.pdf) describes the contract between PLDI organizers and the broader community.  The document was approved in June 2013.  The Chair of the PLDI Steering Committee has the source for the document and is responsible for maintaining it in consultation with the PLDI Steering Committee and the broader community.  


**Most Influential PLDI Paper Award**  

Each year a "Most Influential" PLDI paper from 10 years previously is chosen and an
presentation is made at PLDI. More details about this award and
past winning papers can be found [here](/Awards/Conferences/PLDI). SIGPLAN
also makes several other awards including an "Outstanding
Dissertation Award." Please consider making a nomination for one of
these awards. More details about the SIGPLAN awards can be found
