title: "Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) "
---
The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is a forum for discussion of
dynamic languages, their implementation and application. While mature
dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, Prolog, and
APL continue to grow and inspire new converts, a new generation of
dynamic scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Tcl,
Lua, and Clojure are successful in a wide range of applications. DLS
provides a place for researchers and practitioners to come together and
share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for future research and
development.

Awards
------

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2022 for 2012
    -   Recipients: Thomas Würthinger, Andreas Wöß, Lukas Stadler, Gilles Duboscq, Doug Simon, and Christian Wimmer
    -   Title: Self-optimizing AST interpreters
    -   Conference: DLS 2012
    -   Paper:
        [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2384577.2384587](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2384577.2384587)
    -   Citation: Over the past decade, the authors and their 
        collaborators have taken the ideas from this paper and turned 
        it into the Truffle and GraalVM system, which has 
        revolutionized how we implement languages on the JVM. Today, 
        the GraalVM is a major product and Truffle is a language 
        implementation technology producing high-performance 
        implementations of everything from Ruby to C, all built upon 
        the ideas of AST rewriting in the interpreter.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2021 for 2011
    -   Recipients: Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Erick Lavoie, Marc Feeley, Bruno Dufour
    -   Title: Bootstrapping a Self-Hosted Research Virtual Machine for JavaScript: An Experience Report
    -   Conference: DLS 2011
    -   Paper:
        [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2047849.2047858](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2047849.2047858)
    -   Citation: The 2011 DLS paper "Bootstrapping a Self-Hosted 
        Research Virtual Machine for JavaScript: An Experience 
        Report" is a great overview and source of ideas for virtual 
        machine development. It represents a comprehensive guide to 
        design choices to make in the space and for that it is still 
        notable today.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2020 for 2010
    -   Recipients: Tom Van Cutsem and Mark S. Miller
    -   Title: Proxies: Design Principles for Robust Object-oriented Intercession APIs
    -   Conference: DLS 2010
    -   Paper:
        [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869631.1869638](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869631.1869638)
    -   Citation: The 2010 DLS paper “Proxies: Design Principles for 
        Robust Object-oriented Intercession APIs” is a prime example 
        of the object-capability model. In short order, it managed to 
        bridge the gap from research to become an integral part of 
        an important language today.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2019 for 2009
    -   Recipients: Alexander Yermolovich, Christian Wimmer, and Michael Franz
    -   Title: Optimization of Dynamic Languages Using Hierarchical Layering of Virtual Machines
    -   Conference: DLS 2009
    -   Paper:
        [https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1408688](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1408688)
    -   Citation: This 2009 DLS paper is an important early paper in 
        the area of meta virtual machines. It showed a simple and 
        effective approach to VM construction that was simultaneously 
        explored by multiple research groups at the time and which 
        has since found further applications.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2018 for 2008
    -   Recipients: Jeremy G. Siek and Manish Vachharajani
    -   Title: Gradual Typing With Unification-based Inference
    -   Conference: DLS 2008
    -   Paper:
        [https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1408681.1408688](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1408681.1408688)
    -   Citation: The 2008 DLS paper "Gradual Typing With
        Unification-based Inference" showed that one can increase the
        static guarantees made in a program through an ingenious
        combination of gradual typing and unification-base type
        inference. The ideas underlying this paper have found their way
        into the design of many modern programming languages, and have
        had a strong impact on the research community.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2017 for 2007
    -   Recipients: Stijn Mostinckx, Tom Van Cutsem, Stijn Timbermont, and Éric Tanter
    -   Title: Mirages--Behavioral Intercession in a Mirror-based Architecture
    -   Conference: DLS 2007
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297095](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297095)
    -   Citation: The 2007 DLS paper "Mirages: Behavioral Intercession
        in a Mirror-based Architecture" combined the ideas of explicit
        mirrors for reflective introspection and modification with
        implicit mirrors for behavioral intercession. The work in this
        paper influenced and inspired the design of proxies in the
        JavaScript language, where it now has applications in areas
        such as security, testing, and virtualization of the DOM.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006
    -   Recipients: Armin Rigo and Samuele Pedroni
    -   Title: PyPy's Approach to Virtual Machine Construction
    -   Conference: DLS 2006
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176753](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176753)
    -   Citation: The 2006 DLS paper "PyPy's Approach to Virtual Machine
        Construction" introduced the PyPy Python interpreter and the
        RPython framework. Both are still highly relevant in various
        areas to this day and will continue to be influential for many
        years, thus demonstrating highly impressive long-term vision
        and impact. The paper laid the theoretical and practical
        foundations of constructing a virtual machine from a
        high-level description and was consequently built upon by
        numerous follow-up publications. The software, which continues
        to be developed by a large and active open source community,
        proved extensively usable in multiple academic and industrial
        contexts.

-   Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005
    -   Recipients: Pascal Costanza and Robert Hirschfeld
    -   Title: Language Constructs for Context-oriented Programming--An Overview of ContextL
    -   Conference: DLS 2005
    -   Paper:
        [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146842](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146842)
    -   Citation: The 2005 DLS paper "Language Constructs for
        Context-oriented Programming: An Overview of ContextL"
        introduced a framework that enables programmers to modify the
        behavior of a program based on the context in which it is
        used, without requiring changes to the original program. This
        paper triggered a cascade of research on Context-oriented
        Programming and spawned a community with its own international
        workshop series, which is still going strong today.
