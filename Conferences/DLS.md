title: "Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) "
---
The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is a forum for discussion of
dynamic languages, their implementation and application. While mature
dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, Prolog, and
APL continue to grow and inspire new converts, a new generation of
dynamic scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Tcl,
Lua, and Clojure are successful in a wide range of applications. DLS
provides a place for researchers and practitioners to come together and
share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for future research and
development.
