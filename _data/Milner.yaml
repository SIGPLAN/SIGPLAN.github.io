2012:
  Awardee: Shriram Krishnamurthi
  Citation: |
    The SIGPLAN 2012 Robin Milner Young Researcher Award goes to Shriram
    Krishnamurthi, a prolific researcher who brings programming language
    theory to bear in many other disciplines, thus exposing its
    foundational value. His research contributions range from type
    soundness proofs for Java and influential extensions thereof, through
    foundational aspects of web programming, to model-driven development
    and empirical studies. The most important aspects of Krishnamurthi's
    research are

     - that it cuts across multiple disciplines, including education,
       software engineering, formal methods and security, but always
       building on the firm ground of programming language theory;
     - its orientation towards practicality and applicability to standard
       platforms: programming systems for teaching, reactive web
       programming, executable JavaScript semantics, and analysis
       techniques for security policies;
     - that it has resulted not only in publications, but also in
       practical systems that are used in academia and industry; and
     - the clarity of its exposition and presentation.
     - Shriram is also an influential educator, reaching out beyond the
       university to infect school kids with algebraic thinking.

    In summary, Shriram is an extraordinarily broad researcher, making
    sustained contributions in important and exciting areas, with a
    commitment to education that is ensuring that his ideas have even
    broader impact.
