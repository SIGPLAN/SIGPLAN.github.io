  Awardee: Matthias Felleisen
  Citation: |

    The SIGPLAN 2012 Achievement award has been won by Matthias
    Felleisen, an exemplary researcher whose work covers theory,
    practice, and education, with each reinforcing the others.  He has
    made fundamental contributions across the entire spectrum of the
    programming language field.  He introduced evaluation contexts as
    a notation for specifying operational semantics, and
    progress-and-preservation proofs of type safety, both of which are
    used in scores of research papers each year, often without
    citation.  His other contributions include small-step operational
    semantics for control and state, A-normal form, delimited
    continuations, mixin classes and mixin modules, a fully-abstract
    semantics for Sequential PCF, web programming techniques,
    higher-order contracts with blame, and static typing for dynamic
    languages.

    Matthias tests his ideas by building real systems, working in the
    framework of PLT Scheme, later renamed Racket, which includes
    interactive development environments, interactive debugging and
    flow analysis, documentation tools, and support for language
    levels and multiple languages.  He has coauthored a series of
    influential texts, including four 'little' books&#8212;The Little
    Schemer, The Seasoned Schemer, A Little Java, and The Little
    MLer&#8212;the widely used textbook How to Design Programs, and a
    monograph on Semantics Engineering.  He founded a series of
    workshops and projects to support K&#8211;12 teaching, including
    TeachScheme!, Reach Java, and Program by Design.  Moreover, he has
    nurtured a new generation of researchers, who are now respected in
    their own right and pursue the same goals of excellence, rigor,
    and real-world impact that have characterized Matthias's work.

2011:
  Awardee: Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare, FRS, FREng, FBCS
  Citation: |

    Tony Hoare's long career in computing is studded with seminal
    engineering	 and scientific contributions to Programming Languages;
    his views on programming language design have been recognized as
    profound even by those who declined to follow his advice.

    Two contributions stand out as fundamental: the development of
    what is now known as Hoare logic, and Communicating Sequential
    Processes. Hoare logic is a system for reasoning about imperative
    programs. It was introduced in the 1969 article "An Axiomatic
    Basic for Computer Programming", which is perhaps the most
    influential 6-page paper ever published in CACM. Drawing on
    earlier work of Robert Floyd, an entire sub-area of computer
    science has developed from Hoare's initial ideas; many modern
    verification systems build on Hoare logic.

    Only 9 years later, CACM published Hoare's paper on Communicating
    Sequential Processes (CSP). Contemporary with Milner's CCS, but
    pursuing complementary goals, CSP has been enormously influential.
    It provided the basis for the occam programming language and its
    realization in the Transputer; it has been used for modeling and
    verifying the concurrency properties of critical software systems;
    and it inspired a flowering of subsequent concurrency research.

    Although either of these contributions would alone justify the
    achievement award, Hoare is doing more with his Unifying Theories
    research, which aims to unify theories of programming across
    paradigm, abstraction level and semantic style. Beyond all of
    this, Tony is renowned for his unfailing courtesy, his
    inspiration, and his dedication to his chosen calling. He is the
    epitome of a scholar and a gentleman.

2010:
  Awardee: Gordon D. Plotkin
  Citation: |

    Professor Gordon D. Plotkin has made fundamental advances in
    almost every area of the theory of programming languages. His
    contributions have helped to establish the mathematical
    foundations on which the scientific study of programming languages
    are based.  His 1975 paper "Call-by-name, Call-by-value, and the
    λ-calculus" exposed the relationship between the reduction
    semantics of the λ-calculus and its operational semantics, as
    defined by Landin's SECD machine. In the process, he defined what
    it meant for a calculus and a semantics to correspond: this
    launched the study of operational semantics as it is now
    understood. He invented Structural Operational Semantics as a
    technique for specifying the semantics of a wide range of
    programming languages, concurrent as well as sequential; this form
    of semantics is now one of the basic working tools of researchers
    developing new programming languages and type systems.

    Plotkin's contributions to the development of the mathematical
    theory of domains, and its applications to the denotational
    semantics of programming languages, have been of fundamental
    importance: they include his powerdomain construction, systematic
    development of the general theory of the solution of recursive
    domain equations, and his work on PCF and the full abstraction
    problem.

    Plotkin's work with Glynn Winskel on event structures is the basis
    for reasoning about distributed systems, process algebras, and
    reactive systems. Event structures have been enormously
    influential in the development of models of concurrency. He has
    also investigated the logical foundations of computer security,
    including logics for specifying authorization policies for
    computer systems. Plotkin continues to make bold and deep
    contributions, for example, in his current work on the algebraic
    theory of effects, and on languages and calculi for biochemical
    modelling. Taken together, Gordon Plotkin's contributions over the
    past four decades exhibit a range and depth unmatched in the
    field.

2009:
  Awardee: Rod Burstall
  Citation: |

    Professor Rod Burstall has made deep, seminal contributions to the
    design of programming languages and the field of program
    verification. These contributions, which many of us now take for
    granted, include the introduction of algebraic datatypes coupled
    with pattern-matching clausal function definitions as found in
    Hope, ML, Haskell and Coq; the generalization and use of
    structural induction for proving properties of programs; the
    fold-unfold method for deriving efficient, provably-correct
    programs from easy to understand prototypes; mechanisms for
    reasoning about pointer-based, imperative programs that directly
    led to the development of separation logic; proof techniques and
    connections to modal logic for reasoning about concurrent
    programs; and the use of dependent types and algebraic
    specifications for constructing module systems that directly
    influenced SML and OCaml. Through these amazing contributions and
    his collaborations and mentorship, he helped build one of the most
    important centers of programming research at Edinburgh, which was
    eventually institutionalized as the Laboratory for Foundations of
    Computer Science."


2008:
  Awardee: Barbara Liskov"
  Citation: |

    Professor Barbara Liskov has had tremendous impact on the fields
    of programming languages, operating systems, distributed systems,
    and information security. Much of her early research focus was on
    data abstraction, modularity, and encapsulation as typified by the
    CLU programming language. At the time, CLU incorporated a number
    of advanced features, such as modular encapsulation of abstract
    data types, bounded polymorphism, exceptions, and iterator
    abstraction that had clear influence over successive languages
    including Ada, Modula-3, C++, and Java. Through CLU, the related
    books and articles, her work on behavioral subtyping, and her
    courses on programming methodology, Professor Liskov changed the
    way that a generation of engineers thought about and constructed
    large software systems. Professor Liskov's work on the Argus
    project also brought to the fore the idea of integrating
    transactions and orthogonal persistence into a programming
    language with an aim towards building reliable distributed
    systems. More recently, her work on information flow control
    helped to start a research focus on end-to-end security using
    language-based mechanisms for enforcement."
