- Awardee: Kathryn S. McKinley
  Citation: |

    Kathryn McKinley has made seminal contributions to a number of
    areas in PL, most notably memory management and parallelizing
    compilers.  Her contributions to memory management include some of
    the most innovative and effective algorithms available for garbage
    collection and memory allocation. …  She served in leadership
    roles in numerous SIGPLAN conferences and was instrumental in
    introducing double blind reviewing to the programming languages
    community, seeking to reduce bias and improve scientific quality.
    McKinley also played a key role in advancing women and minorities
    in programming languages, and more generally, within computer
    science. She has energetically championed this cause and has been
    a dedicated mentor to her 23 PhD students and countless other
    researchers. In short, Kathryn McKinley is the "whole picture" of
    what the SIGPLAN achievement award seeks to recognize.

2022:
- Awardee: Xavier Leroy
  Citation: |

    Xavier Leroy has made fundamental contributions to both the theory
    and practice of programming languages on a range of topics,
    including type system and module system design, efficient
    compilation of functional programming languages, bytecode
    verification, verified compilation, and verified static
    analysis. He is known as the main architect of the OCaml
    programming language and the author of the CompCert verified
    compiler for C. Both of these projects have had enormous impact in
    the PL community and beyond, and they have significantly pushed
    the boundaries of what is perceived as possible.
 
    Among Xavier Leroy’s many accomplishments, his OCaml language
    introduced numerous advances in language design and implementation
    and created a solid platform that enabled the work of thousands of
    others in both research and industry.  OCaml has been used to
    build widely-used theorem provers (e.g., Coq) as well as operating
    system hypervisors (e.g., Xen). OCaml has also played a key role
    in a number of companies (Jane St. Capital) and has inspired
    numerous variants and follow-on designs (F#, Scala).
 
    Another enormous feat of Xavier Leroy's research is the
    development of the CompCert C compiler, which opened up a whole
    new area of activity and demonstrated the feasibility of formally
    verifying the full functional correctness of a compiler for a
    mainstream programming language.  This accomplishment created a
    true change in people's perceptions of what is possible and
    inspired many researchers to succeed at similar feats across a
    variety of domains.

2021:
- Awardee: Robert (Bob) Harper
  Citation: |
    Robert (Bob) Harper is widely known for his foundational
    contributions to our understanding of type theory and its use in
    the design, specification, implementation, and verification of
    modern programming languages.  Bob demonstrated that sound type
    systems and operational semantics are not only appropriate
    vehicles for reasoning about idealized languages, but that this
    theory can be applied to complex, modern languages. His
    achievements include analysis of language features ranging from
    references to continuations to modules, the definition of a
    variety of new type systems, the idea of using types throughout
    the compilation process, the analysis of run-time system semantics
    and cost, a formal definition of Standard ML and its
    mechanization, the definition of logical framework LF and other
    logical frameworks based on homotopy type theory.
 
    Some of Bob’s most influential work involved the design, theory
    and implementation of the TIL (Typed Intermediate Language)
    compiler system, which pioneered the idea that compilers can
    propagate type information to lower-level intermediate languages,
    where it can be used to guide optimizations and to catch compiler
    bugs. These ideas led directly to the development of
    proof-carrying code, typed assembly language, and a wide array of
    type-preserving compilers.
 
    Bob Harper has also had a profound impact though his mentorship,
    teaching and the influence of his books "Programming in Standard
    ML" and "Practical Foundations for Programming Languages."

2020:
- Awardee: Hans-J. Boehm
  Citation: |
    Hans Boehm has made fundamental, pioneering contributions on a number of 
    topics, including garbage collection, programming language memory models 
    and thread semantics. His work stands for a style of pragmatically-driven 
    research with an emphasis on solving problems in widely-used languages - 
    it has made life better for many practicing programmers.
    
    Hans is the primary author of the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collection 
    (GC) library, the first to enable automatic deallocation of memory for most 
    C programs -- a surprising result at that time. Its low overhead made 
    automatic GC widely accessible, enabling many language implementations to 
    get off the ground quickly, with competitive GC performance. Initially 
    published in 1988, the library is still widely used. It likely significantly 
    accelerated the widespread adoption of GC and also enabled many modern C/C++ 
    memory leak detectors for non-garbage-collected programs. Hans' papers based 
    on this library provided major new insights into both this "conservative" 
    style of GC, and GC in general - his sole-author 1993 "most influential" PLDI 
    paper showed how to greatly reduce the space cost of "conservative" GC, and 
    his PLDI’91 paper introduced "sticky bit" collection, later adopted by mainstream 
    Java collectors.
    
    Hans is the leading authority on programming language memory models and thread 
    semantics. The theory of memory models is complex, with subtleties still not well 
    understood. Defining the model for a popular language is even harder, requiring 
    balancing conflicting constituencies – teachable to the masses, performance for 
    advanced programmers, and compatibility with legacy and future hardware. Leading 
    the C++11 process, Hans miraculously managed to satisfy all constituencies. He 
    argued for the core model to be the teachable “sequential-consistency for 
    data-race-free” model, but additionally developed an alternate path for advanced 
    programmers and non-compatible hardware using the concept of relaxed atomics. 
    Along the way, Hans wrote several seminal papers. The PLDI’05 paper exposed 
    problems with the then-prevalent approach of implementing threads as a library, 
    the PLDI’08 paper described the C++ model, and a series of papers exposed hitherto 
    unknown problems with benign data races, fences, seqlocks, and subtleties in the 
    notorious out-of-thin-air (OOTA) issue. Hans was also a major contributor to the 
    Java memory model effort, a precursor to the C++ effort, and his C++ work has 
    influenced analogous OOTA related open problems for Java. It is impossible to 
    overstate Hans’ impact on the understanding and practice of language memory models. 
    He has had profound influence on the boundary between PL and computer architecture 
    communities.

2019:
- Awardee: Alex Aiken
  Citation: |
    Alex Aiken has made fundamental, pioneering or breakthrough 
    contributions on a number of topics, including constraint-based 
    program analysis, statistical bug localization, super optimization, 
    program synthesis, and parallel programming systems, among others. 
    Alex's research combines foundational theoretical results with 
    practical implementations and thorough empirical evaluations.
    
    Perhaps Alex's most significant work is on constraint-based analysis. 
    Starting with early work on soft typing for functional programs, he 
    subsequently developed the theory and practice of constraint-based 
    analysis for several key applications. He developed what was at the 
    time the most scalable and precise points-to analysis for C and 
    subsequently exploited distributed, SAT-based constraint solving to 
    perform static analysis at a level of precision and scalability that 
    had not been seen before. Alex's research on cooperative bug isolation 
    introduced the idea of using lightweight dynamic analysis at scale to 
    find the causes of bugs in software systems that have been fielded. 
    His work on data representation synthesis showed how to automatically 
    construct low-level data structure implementations from high-level 
    descriptions. His STOKE project revitalizes the old idea of 
    super-optimization by using stochastic search to find significantly 
    better code than general-purpose compilers. Finally, Alex is the 
    developer of Moss (&quot;a Measure of Software Similarity&quot;), a web 
    service that finds duplicate code, even if it has been alpha-converted or 
    transformed in other ways. Most notably, Moss continues to be used for 
    plagiarism detection by many Computer Science departments and others 
    around the world. 
    
    Not only has Alex's research led the field in important new directions, 
    but his publications exemplify high-quality work in programming languages.
    To date, he is likely the most prolific author in POPL and PLDI, two 
    flagship programming languages venues, and his publications have received 
    many recognitions. Alex also stands out for his outstanding mentorship. He 
    has graduated 24 PhD students, many of whom have won awards for their work 
    and gone on to distinguished careers in academia and industry. Last but not 
    least, Alex has provided dedicated service and strong leadership to the 
    SIGPLAN community, serving as the program chair for both POPL and PLDI, the 
    general chair for POPL, as an associate editor for TOPLAS, and chair and 
    member on various SIGPLAN award committees.

2017:
- Awardee: Thomas W. Reps
  Citation: |
    Thomas Reps has made exceptional contributions to the field of
    programming languages, on a diverse range of topics that include
    incremental computation, program slicing and dataflow analysis,
    shape analysis, and analysis of binary code.

    Tom's dissertation research on generating language-based
    environments applies incremental attribute grammar evaluation to
    problems such as name analysis and type checking, and is broadly
    applicable to a wide range of languages. This work has been
    commercialized successfully by Grammatech and it has deeply
    influenced research on integrated development environments.  Tom's
    work on program slicing and dataflow analysis builds on an elegant
    framework for solving context-free reachability problems. This
    work has been extremely influential in the academic community, and
    it has had huge impact in industry (e.g., IBM products for
    security analysis and Microsoft's tools for verifying device
    drivers).  Tom's work on shape analysis relies on three-valued
    logic to solve difficult problems in shape analysis, and has had
    major impact on the verification community. His more recent work
    on analyzing x86 binary code has applied techniques from his
    previous work on dataflow analysis and slicing to the intensely
    challenging problem of analyzing machine code with significant
    success, and has been commercialized by GrammaTech.

    A common thread in all of Tom's research is that it provides
    elegant solutions to deep foundational problems. Many of these
    solutions have become widely adopted, resulting in an unusual
    level of practical and industrial impact. His publications exhibit
    an exemplary degree of scholarship, with precise exposition that
    facilitates adoption by the community. He has received numerous
    significant awards throughout his career, starting with the 1983
    ACM Dissertation Award, and his citation impact is among the
    highest in the entire field of programming languages.


2016:
- Awardee: Simon Peyton Jones
  Citation: |
    Simon Peyton Jones is widely known as an essential force behind
    the design, implementation, evolution, and remarkable success of
    the Haskell language and the Glasgow Haskell Compiler for more
    than twenty years.  His role as a primary designer of the Haskell
    language and the GHC implementation of Haskell has produced a
    platform for hundreds of researchers and many more developers.
    Indeed, GHC is unparalleled for achieving what might otherwise be
    seen as an engineering impossibility: the leading implementation
    of an increasingly popular programming language for both research
    experimentation and serious industrial use.  While the rise of
    Haskell and GHC -- and its influence on other languages -- is the
    shared result of a vibrant community of many, it is also fair to
    describe it as inextricable from Simon's career.

    Among Simon's technical contributions to language design is
    leading work in monadic I/O, type classes, generalized abstract
    data types, composable transactional memory, generic programming
    via "scrap your boilerplate", advances in type inference, and
    more.  His work on functional-language implementation has been no
    less influential and wide-ranging, with a compiler design based on
    a typed intermediate language and optimizations expressed via
    declarative rewriting.  In making Haskell a practical language, he
    collaborated to design and implement novel approaches to
    concurrency, foreign function interfaces, space profiling, and
    nested data parallelism.

    Beyond all these technical advances and many more, Simon is widely
    recognized as a visionary leader in the field, an articulate
    writer, an extraordinarily effective speaker, an agent of change
    in computing education, a generous collaborator, and a peerless
    mentor.  His remarkable contributions to the field of programming
    languages arise from technical sophistication, impeccable taste,
    boundless enthusiasm, and charismatic leadership.

2015:
- Awardee: Luca Cardelli
  Citation: |
    Luca Cardelli has made exceptional contributions to the field of
    programming languages. He has a remarkable ability to re-invent
    himself every decade or so and yet continue to make true
    innovations.  His contributions span many areas: software;
    language design, including experimental languages; programming
    language foundations; and the interaction of programming languages
    and biology.

    He is a leading language designer. He was one of the designers of
    Modula-3, which played a major role in popularising the notion of
    type-safe programming, and was a key influence on Java and C#.
    Thus, his work helped lay the foundations for today's
    near-universal industrial acceptance of type-safe programming
    languages.  He also designed several important experimental
    languages, including Obliq, a distributed higher-order scripting
    language, and Polyphonic C#, a distributed extension of C#.  He
    implemented the first compiler for ML.

    He is a leading and hugely influential computer scientist. His
    most sustained research activity has been in establishing the
    semantic and type-theoretic foundations of programming languages.
    Two of his most prominent works are his 1985 paper "On
    understanding types, data abstraction, and polymorphism" (with
    Wegner) and his 1996 book "A Theory of Objects" (with Abadi).
    Other important works of his concern the semantics of multiple
    inheritance in object-oriented languages and explicit
    substitutions in the lambda-calculus.

    More recently, he has focused on modeling global and mobile
    computation, via the Ambient Calculus and spatial logics. His work
    pioneered an influential way of describing, programming, and
    reasoning about global and mobile computation, in terms of formal
    calculi and language constructs. It also connected with an
    important line of work on semi-structured data, and led,
    indirectly, to his current interest in biology and stochastic
    systems.

    In both his own work and his great scientific influence Cardelli
    has made lasting contributions to the field of programming
    languages.


2014:
- Awardee: Neil Jones
  Citation: |
    Neil Jones is a pioneer of programming-language methods.  He
    introduced control-flow analysis for higher-order programs,
    binding-time analysis to tame self-applicable partial evaluation,
    what is known today as "Jones optimality", and size-change
    termination analysis. Neil is also noted for bridges he
    established between programming languages and
    complexity/computability theory, e.g., characterizing Turing's
    Universal Machine as self interpretation, Kleene's S-m-n theorem
    as partial evaluation, Kleene's second recursion theorem as
    reflection, and the expressive power of typed cons-free functional
    languages by means of complexity classes.  His pioneering work on
    complexity theory included the development of completeness for P
    and solving the spectrum problem (the basis of finite model
    theory).  Lastly, Neil is a tireless and inspiring mentor, and he
    has written several influential textbooks that are testaments to
    his thesis that programs are data objects and that programming
    languages are a cornerstone of computer science.


2013:
- Awardee: Patrick and Radhia Cousot
  Citation: |
    Patrick and Radhia Cousot are the co-inventors of abstract
    interpretation, a unifying theory of sound abstraction and
    approximation of structures involved in various domains of
    computer science, such as formal semantics, specification, proof,
    and verification.  In particular, abstract interpretation has had
    a major impact on the development of the static analysis of
    software.  In their original work, the Cousots showed how to
    relate a static analysis to a language's standard semantics by
    means of a second, abstract semantics that makes precise which
    features of the full language are being modeled and which are
    being discarded (or abstracted), providing for the first time both
    a formal definition of and clear methodology for designing and
    proving the correctness of static analyses.  Subsequently, the
    Cousots contributed many of the building blocks of abstract
    interpretation in use today, including chaotic iteration,
    widening, narrowing, combinations of abstractions, and a number of
    widely used abstract domains.  This work has developed a
    remarkable set of intellectual tools and has found its way into
    practice in the form of widely used libraries and frameworks.
    Finally, the Cousots and their collaborators have contributed to
    demonstrating the utility of static analysis to society.  They led
    the development of the Astrée static analyzer, which is used in
    the medical, automotive, and aerospace industry for verifying the
    absence of a large class of common programming errors in low-level
    embedded systems code. This achievement stands as one of the most
    substantial successes of program verification to date.


2012:
- Awardee: Matthias Felleisen
  Citation: |
    The SIGPLAN 2012 Achievement award has been won by Matthias
    Felleisen, an exemplary researcher whose work covers theory,
    practice, and education, with each reinforcing the others.  He has
    made fundamental contributions across the entire spectrum of the
    programming language field.  He introduced evaluation contexts as
    a notation for specifying operational semantics, and
    progress-and-preservation proofs of type safety, both of which are
    used in scores of research papers each year, often without
    citation.  His other contributions include small-step operational
    semantics for control and state, A-normal form, delimited
    continuations, mixin classes and mixin modules, a fully-abstract
    semantics for Sequential PCF, web programming techniques,
    higher-order contracts with blame, and static typing for dynamic
    languages.

    Matthias tests his ideas by building real systems, working in the
    framework of PLT Scheme, later renamed Racket, which includes
    interactive development environments, interactive debugging and
    flow analysis, documentation tools, and support for language
    levels and multiple languages.  He has coauthored a series of
    influential texts, including four 'little' books&#8212;The Little
    Schemer, The Seasoned Schemer, A Little Java, and The Little
    MLer&#8212;the widely used textbook How to Design Programs, and a
    monograph on Semantics Engineering.  He founded a series of
    workshops and projects to support K&#8211;12 teaching, including
    TeachScheme!, Reach Java, and Program by Design.  Moreover, he has
    nurtured a new generation of researchers, who are now respected in
    their own right and pursue the same goals of excellence, rigor,
    and real-world impact that have characterized Matthias's work.

2011:
- Awardee: Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare, FRS, FREng, FBCS
  Citation: |
    Tony Hoare's long career in computing is studded with seminal
    engineering	 and scientific contributions to Programming Languages;
    his views on programming language design have been recognized as
    profound even by those who declined to follow his advice.

    Two contributions stand out as fundamental: the development of
    what is now known as Hoare logic, and Communicating Sequential
    Processes. Hoare logic is a system for reasoning about imperative
    programs. It was introduced in the 1969 article "An Axiomatic
    Basic for Computer Programming", which is perhaps the most
    influential 6-page paper ever published in CACM. Drawing on
    earlier work of Robert Floyd, an entire sub-area of computer
    science has developed from Hoare's initial ideas; many modern
    verification systems build on Hoare logic.

    Only 9 years later, CACM published Hoare's paper on Communicating
    Sequential Processes (CSP). Contemporary with Milner's CCS, but
    pursuing complementary goals, CSP has been enormously influential.
    It provided the basis for the occam programming language and its
    realization in the Transputer; it has been used for modeling and
    verifying the concurrency properties of critical software systems;
    and it inspired a flowering of subsequent concurrency research.

    Although either of these contributions would alone justify the
    achievement award, Hoare is doing more with his Unifying Theories
    research, which aims to unify theories of programming across
    paradigm, abstraction level and semantic style. Beyond all of
    this, Tony is renowned for his unfailing courtesy, his
    inspiration, and his dedication to his chosen calling. He is the
    epitome of a scholar and a gentleman.

2010:
- Awardee: Gordon D. Plotkin
  Citation: |
    Professor Gordon D. Plotkin has made fundamental advances in
    almost every area of the theory of programming languages. His
    contributions have helped to establish the mathematical
    foundations on which the scientific study of programming languages
    are based.  His 1975 paper "Call-by-name, Call-by-value, and the
    λ-calculus" exposed the relationship between the reduction
    semantics of the λ-calculus and its operational semantics, as
    defined by Landin's SECD machine. In the process, he defined what
    it meant for a calculus and a semantics to correspond: this
    launched the study of operational semantics as it is now
    understood. He invented Structural Operational Semantics as a
    technique for specifying the semantics of a wide range of
    programming languages, concurrent as well as sequential; this form
    of semantics is now one of the basic working tools of researchers
    developing new programming languages and type systems.

    Plotkin's contributions to the development of the mathematical
    theory of domains, and its applications to the denotational
    semantics of programming languages, have been of fundamental
    importance: they include his powerdomain construction, systematic
    development of the general theory of the solution of recursive
    domain equations, and his work on PCF and the full abstraction
    problem.

    Plotkin's work with Glynn Winskel on event structures is the basis
    for reasoning about distributed systems, process algebras, and
    reactive systems. Event structures have been enormously
    influential in the development of models of concurrency. He has
    also investigated the logical foundations of computer security,
    including logics for specifying authorization policies for
    computer systems. Plotkin continues to make bold and deep
    contributions, for example, in his current work on the algebraic
    theory of effects, and on languages and calculi for biochemical
    modelling. Taken together, Gordon Plotkin's contributions over the
    past four decades exhibit a range and depth unmatched in the
    field.

2009:
- Awardee: Rod Burstall
  Citation: |
    Professor Rod Burstall has made deep, seminal contributions to the
    design of programming languages and the field of program
    verification. These contributions, which many of us now take for
    granted, include the introduction of algebraic datatypes coupled
    with pattern-matching clausal function definitions as found in
    Hope, ML, Haskell and Coq; the generalization and use of
    structural induction for proving properties of programs; the
    fold-unfold method for deriving efficient, provably-correct
    programs from easy to understand prototypes; mechanisms for
    reasoning about pointer-based, imperative programs that directly
    led to the development of separation logic; proof techniques and
    connections to modal logic for reasoning about concurrent
    programs; and the use of dependent types and algebraic
    specifications for constructing module systems that directly
    influenced SML and OCaml. Through these amazing contributions and
    his collaborations and mentorship, he helped build one of the most
    important centers of programming research at Edinburgh, which was
    eventually institutionalized as the Laboratory for Foundations of
    Computer Science."


2008:
- Awardee: Barbara Liskov
  Citation: |
    Professor Barbara Liskov has had tremendous impact on the fields
    of programming languages, operating systems, distributed systems,
    and information security. Much of her early research focus was on
    data abstraction, modularity, and encapsulation as typified by the
    CLU programming language. At the time, CLU incorporated a number
    of advanced features, such as modular encapsulation of abstract
    data types, bounded polymorphism, exceptions, and iterator
    abstraction that had clear influence over successive languages
    including Ada, Modula-3, C++, and Java. Through CLU, the related
    books and articles, her work on behavioral subtyping, and her
    courses on programming methodology, Professor Liskov changed the
    way that a generation of engineers thought about and constructed
    large software systems. Professor Liskov's work on the Argus
    project also brought to the fore the idea of integrating
    transactions and orthogonal persistence into a programming
    language with an aim towards building reliable distributed
    systems. More recently, her work on information flow control
    helped to start a research focus on end-to-end security using
    language-based mechanisms for enforcement."
