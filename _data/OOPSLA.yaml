  Citation: |
    GPU programming is supported by abstractions like CUDA and OpenCL.
    To gain the performance benefits of GPUs, these abstractions
    present a programming model that offers the potential for
    introducing subtle concurrency bugs like data races and barrier
    divergences.  This paper presents the first GPU program
    verification method -- GPUVerify.  GPUVerify translates GPU
    programs into a sequential Boogie program that encodes the aspects
    of program behavior that give rise to data races and barrier
    divergence.  Discharging proofs of the resulting programs requires
    appropriate inductive invariants and the paper identifies a
    collection of idiomatic invariants present in GPU programs that
    enable cost-effective verification.  GPUVerify opened up a new
    problem space for verification research and the open-source tools
    developed on the project have been of use to practitioners and are
    recommended by major hardware manufacturers.

  Citation: |
    SugarJ, already recognized as a distinguished paper at OOPSLA back
    in 2011, is a highly influential work on library-based syntactic
    language extensibility. This paper introduced the notion of "sugar
    libraries" for syntactically extending a language within the
    language. Unlike meta-programming/macro systems that typically
    rely on a pre-processor built on top of an existing language,
    syntactic extensions in SugarJ are built in the language. As a
    consequence, SugarJ has better composability properties than macro
    systems. Beyond making valuable theoretical contributions, SugarJ
    is available online and has been incorporated into Eclipse.

  Citation: |
    Spoofax is a platform for developing textual domain-specific
    languages. It is a comprehensive environment that includes the
    tools to specify new languages, produces language processing tools
    such as type checkers, compilers, and interpreters, and support
    for integration in leading IDEs.  Spoofax is used in industry and
    research, e.g., to develop WebDSL - a language that is one of the
    underpinnings of the researchr system used for many conference
    websites.  Spoofax is rooted in a long line of research going back
    to the ASF+SDF MetaEnvironment, the SDF2 syntax definition
    formalism, and the Stratego transformation language. Spoofax is
    the basis for a line of further research in declarative language
    definition. This paper is the main scientific publication
    describing the entire environment in its 1.0 release and
    documenting the requirements and architecture for a language
    workbench.

    (for 2009) _[Flapjax: a programming language for Ajax applications](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1640091)_
  Citation: |
    Flapjax reimagines how to program client-based web applications by 
    using abstractions dedicated to facilitating communication intensive 
    applications with interactive interfaces. There are two central such 
    abstractions in Flapjax, which were adopted from functional reactive 
    programming: Event streams and so-called behaviors, with the latter 
    modeling computations that bring themselves automatically up-to-date 
    whenever data and computations they depend on change. This lets 
    callbacks that are typically used in applications with interactive 
    interfaces disappear from their designs … and with them also the hell 
    of complexity they cause. Flapjax seamlessly builds on top of JavaScript 
    without requiring a dedicated runtime and thus interoperates with 
    existing applications written in JavaScript. This design choice lowers 
    the barrier to entry and makes the language approachable to novice users. 
    In terms of modern usage, the reactive style and event stream abstraction 
    advocated by Flapjax have been adopted widely, both in mobile apps and on 
    the web. Moreover, recent research has shown that beyond interactivity, 
    behavior abstractions also facilitate correct-by-design distributed 
    applications in presence of concurrency as well as crash and communication 
    faults.

  Citation: |
    The jStar paper is notable for introducing an approach to specifying 
    OO design patterns that has since become standard and is used in 
    modern tools such as VeriFast.  The approach is amenable to 
    automation and extends to patterns such as Subject-Observer, in 
    which there is not a strict hierarchical relationship between objects.  
    The paper also describes a fully automated verification approach that 
    required no proof hints within methods, inspiring the development of 
    a number of later verification tools for separation logic.

  Citation: |
    The paper by Georges et al. has been widely influential in Java
    performance evaluation. Before this paper, Java performance
    evaluation methodologies had varied widely, leading to difficulty
    in comparisons and often misleading conclusions. The authors
    survey several past studies, carefully discuss discrepancies in
    experimental and reporting methodologies, and expose the pitfalls
    of benchmarking approaches.  The fundamental problem is that
    without an appropriate statistical analysis, it is difficult to
    tell whether reported measurements in the literature reflect
    significant distinctions or just random fluctuations. The paper
    proposes a statistically rigorous approach for experimental
    measurements in the Java setting, ways to mitigate uncertainty,
    and even new reporting techniques. The paper also introduced
    JavaStats, publicly available software that monitors the
    variability in measurements to determine how many measurements
    will be needed in all to reach a desired level of statistical
    confidence.

  Citation: |
    The DaCapo benchmarks have become the de facto standard Java
    benchmarking suite, quickly replacing older suites, such as the
    SPEC JVM benchmarks. This paper describes principles for the
    selection and application of benchmarks for modern applications
    languages, and realizes those principles by proposing a set of
    client-side Java benchmarks based on real open source programs.
    The benchmarks were a notable improvement over previous benchmarks
    such as SPEC Java, for example because they more comprehensively
    test aspects of the Java virtual machine and memory management
    system. The paper puts forward a compelling model for benchmark
    selection and evaluation methodologies, and discusses in detail
    the experimental evaluation intricacies of the Java setting. The
    paper also introduces new metrics and contains detailed
    measurements of program behavior. The DaCapo paper has set a
    standard that substantially raised the level of Java experiments
    in the overall literature of the past decade. Since the paper's
    publication, its methodological guidance and benchmarks have been
    widely adopted in research on language implementation techniques
    ranging from optimization to memory management, resulting in a
    significant impact on the quality of research in the field.

  Citation: |
    This paper presents X10, an object-oriented programming language
    based on the Java language and extended to make parallel
    programming effective and convenient for high-performance and
    high-productivity programming of non-uniform cluster computing
    systems --- that is, computing systems in which both processor
    resources and memory resources are distributed.  X10 highlights
    the explicit reification of locality in the form of places;
    supports explicitly controlled distribution and parallel
    processing of arrays; and allows the use of either lock-free
    synchronization using atomic blocks or explicit barrier
    synchronization using a novel clock mechanism.  Although variants
    of some of these mechanisms had been explored in other language
    designs, X10 brought modern programming facilities to the
    scientific computing community by synthesizing a particularly
    useful combination of facilities within the Java language
    framework.

  Citation: |
    Bracha and Ungar's "Mirrors" paper describes a novel approach to
    reflection in object-oriented API design, in which reflection is
    broken off into a modular meta-level capability instead of being baked
    into the functionality of base-level classes.  Mirrors have had a
    strong influence on subsequent designs for reflection capabilities,
    extensibility in support of domain-specific languages, and
    metacircular virtual machines.  They are at the foundation of
    reflection libraries in Scala and Dart, as well as the Java Debugger
    Interface (JDI) design, which offers reflective control of Java VMs.
    As for the paper itself, the committee felt it was a prime
    representative of the strengths of OOPSLA in delivering important and
    influential ideas with clarity and simplicity.

  Citation: |
    In this paper, Harris and Fraser demonstrated how to leverage the
    memory safety and automatic memory management features of a concurrent
    object-oriented language to build a Software Transactional Memory
    (STM) abstraction that is tightly integrated with the language.  In
    particular, their core contribution was to show how conditional
    critical regions (CCRs) could provide a higher-level language
    interface to STM, rather than requiring manipulation of the STM
    through low-level operations.  In so doing, they also developed a more
    efficient implementation infrastructure for CCRs than was available
    previously, and their implementation was pay-as-you-go in the sense of
    not imposing high overhead on those parts of a program where CCRs are
    not required.  Coming ten years after STM was first proposed, this
    work opened the door for a decade of research in languages and
    architecture for concurrency control.

    Custom memory management is often used in systems software for the
    purpose of decreasing the cost of allocation and tightly
    controlling memory footprint of the software.  Until 2002, it was
    taken for granted that application-specific memory allocators were
    superior to general purpose libraries.  Berger, Zorn and
    McKinley's paper demonstrated through a rigorous empirical study
    that this assumption is not well-founded, and gave insights into
    the reasons why general purpose allocators can outperform
    handcrafted ones.  The paper also stands out for the quality of
    its empirical methodology.

  Citation: |
    The Multitasking Virtual Machine (MVM) described in this paper was the first usable and complete Java
    VM (JVM) to support safe, secure, and scalable multitasking. Safety is achieved by strict but lightweight
    isolation of applications from one another. Security comes via resource control mechanisms that prevent
    some denial-of-service attacks. Scalability derives from sharing as much of the run-time system as
    possible among applications and replicating everything else. MVM has since had significant influence on
    the design of other VMs, including Google's Dalvik JVM for mobile platforms. MVM was the setting for
    subsequent work resulting in the Isolates programming interface. Isolation is the basis for many
    infrastructures for both mobile devices and backend Clouds. Indeed, the recently announced Dart
    language for structured Web programming relies on Isolates as its foundation for concurrent
    programming.

  Citation: |
    The 2000 OOPSLA paper "Adaptive Optimization in the Jalape&#241;o JVM"
    describes the architecture of adaptive optimization in what is now
    known as the Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine), continuing a
    line of research in dynamic adaptive optimizing compilers including
    Self and Animorphic (later HotSpot). The novelty of this paper was
    its use of continuous sampling to obtain execution statistics for
    optimized as well as unoptimized code. Also, because Jikes RVM is
    written entirely in Java, the techniques apply not only to the
    application but also to the VM and its components. Follow-on work
    has used, refined, and extended upon this adaptive optimization
    infrastructure. The paper has inspired significant further
    innovation in dynamic profiling and remains a primary reference for
    its exposition of the basic ingredients of adaptive optimization
    for modern VM-based languages.

    In their 1997 OOPSLA paper "Call Graph Construction in
    Object-Oriented Languages," David Grove, Greg DeFouw, Jeffrey Dean,
    and Craig Chambers studied the existing algorithms for call-graph
    construction in object-oriented languages and brought them together
    into a unified framework. This framework is both theoretical,
    allowing the authors to compare the precision of the different
    algorithms, and also practical in that they built a single
    parameterized implementation of all of the algorithms. This
    implementation allowed them to conduct a thorough empirical
    evaluation of the algorithms, which had not been previously
    possible because the algorithms had been implemented separately and
    applied to different programs. In the process, the authors
    discovered and evaluated a few new variations suggested by their
    framework. This kind of consolidation paper is important for moving
    the field forward since it provides theoretical models to build on
    and performance evaluations as benchmarks. It has served as a model
    for later work of this kind.
