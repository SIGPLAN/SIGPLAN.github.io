# This is a list of conferences SIGPLAN "regularly sponsors." Preserving these
# comments about the fuzziness of that definition:
#
# <!-- (BCP) Is this the correct list of "regularly sponsored" conferences?
#       (E.g., should CGO be included?  Should CC?)  How should the list be
#       sorted? -->
#
# <!-- (AF) What does "regularly" mean? Permanently? If I remember correctly we 
#       issued CC a 2-3 year sponsorship to be revisited later. Is that "regular"?
#       Also, I don't have a way of checking the list, other than sending an
#       email to everyone to report discrepancies. Shall we? -->
