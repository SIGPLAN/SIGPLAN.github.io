- Awardee: "Pin"
  Citation: |
    Pin is a dynamic binary instrumentation platform, developed and 
    actively supported for over 15 years by Intel. Through an extensive 
    API for instrumentation of applications at different abstraction levels, 
    Pin supports the creation of custom program analysis and profiling tools, 
    hardware simulators, or binary translators. By supporting such scenarios 
    for complex production applications, Pin has enabled research across many 
    domains including programming languages, computer architecture, security, 
    mobile systems, networking, embedded systems, operating systems, and 
    high-performance computing. In particular, Pin opened the door for 
    instrumentation of x86 binaries across a wide range of platforms and 
    operating systems, thus changing the landscape of computer architecture 
    and programming language research. To maintain transparency towards 
    applications while achieving unprecedented low runtime overheads, Pin 
    uses a wide array of optimizations rooted in the dynamic binary translation
    and instrumentation technology pioneered by the SIGPLAN community, such as 
    just in time compilation of basic blocks, and trampolines from such code 
    fragments to others. Pin is also widely used in the classroom of numerous 
    universities at both undergraduate and graduate levels.
    
2019:
- Awardee: "Scala"
  Citation: |
    Scala is one of the few programming languages from academia that 
    has had a significant impact on the world as well as on programming 
    languages research. It enjoys significant industrial adoption, with 
    early adopters like Twitter and LinkedIn serving as catalysts; it 
    forms the basis of the widely used Apache Spark data analytics 
    platform. Scala's impact on PL research includes the idiom of 
    implicits, which have found their way into other languages; attempts
    to formalize Scala’s type system have pushed the boundaries of type 
    systems research, culminating in the Dependent Object Types (DOT) 
    calculus. In addition, Scala has been a fertile research ground for m
    etaprogramming, macros, staging, and embedded domain-specific languages, 
    including DSLs for machine learning and GPU execution (Delite and OptiML).
 

2018:
- Awardee: "Racket"
  Citation: |
    Racket comprises a programming language, an IDE, and a large 
    ecosystem of libraries and packages. Its contributions have been 
    singularly significant both in research and education. Over the 
    past 20 years, Racket has enabled a wide spectrum of programming 
    language research: it initiated work on recursive, first-class 
    modules, provided a test bed for functional reactive programming, 
    generalized software contracts to higher-order settings, and 
    participated in launching the area of gradual typing. Most 
    importantly, Racket is a leading programming language for making 
    programming languages, due to is results on language extensibility, 
    an active area of research for the emerging language community. 
    With DrRacket, the Racket community has innovated the design of 
    pedagogic IDEs, introducing the transparent read-eval-print loop, 
    algebraic stepping, and the idea of hierarchies of teaching languages. 
    The IDE has played a key role in spreading the word about novel text 
    books on programming ("How to Design Programs") and programming languages 
    ("Programming Languages: Implementations and Applications" and “Semantics 
    Engineering"), bringing concepts dear to SIGPLAN to students all over 
    the world.

2016:
- Awardee: "V8 JavaScript Engine"
  Citation: |
    V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed at Google that
    revolutionized the use of JavaScript, firmly establishing it as a
    platform both in the browser and on the server. V8's success is in
    large part due to the efficient machine code it generates; because
    JavaScript is a highly dynamic object-oriented language, many
    experts believed that this level of performance could not be
    achieved.  V8, whose principal architect is Lars Bak, relies on
    more than 20 years of research in compilation and implementation
    techniques initially developed for Beta, Self, and Sun's Hotspot
    JVM.  These techniques include hidden class recovery in a
    classless language (based on profiled executions of the JS
    programs) followed by on-the-fly in-place inline caching.  V8's
    garbage collector is also very high quality, important for (e.g.,)
    graphically intensive interactive web apps.  V8's techniques have
    influenced other major JS engines, contributing to the
    JavaScript-as-a-platform revolution.  Its performance breakthrough
    has had a major impact on the adoption of JavaScript, which is
    nowadays used on the browser, the server, and probably tomorrow on
    the small devices of the internet-of-things.

2015:
- Awardee: "Z3 Theorem Prover"
  Citation: |
    Z3 has changed the way SIGPLAN members tackle problems of static
    analysis and program synthesis.  Such problems, which form a
    significant part of programming languages research and
    development, had long been tackled using various automated
    decision procedures.  But in the 2000s, Z3 enabled qualitative and
    quantitative leaps, in both the difficulty and the size of
    problems that could be solved.  Today, Z3 is a standard tool, not
    only because of its inherent qualities, such as heuristics that
    militate in favor of short proofs and short refutations, but
    because its developers have continually improved it through close
    engagement with their users.  Such users include many researchers
    in program analysis and synthesis, and improvements made on behalf
    of one user often help many others working in the same domain.  In
    the domain of decision procedures that support program analysis
    and synthesis, after many years of accumulated improvements, Z3 is
    now the unquestioned leader.

2014:
- Awardee: The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
  Citation: |
    The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) provides a portable,
    production-quality, standards-compliant, highly optimizing
    compiler, supporting more architectures, programming languages,
    and operating environments than any other comparable tool.  It
    provides the toolchain that underpins all of the GNU/Linux
    distributions, popular websites, and embedded environments.

    GCC provides the foundation for numerous experiments in
    programming language design, including the early C++ language,
    numerous evolutions of the C and C++ standards, parallel
    programming with OpenMP, and the Go programming language.  GCC has
    been used by many research projects, leading to high-impact
    publications and contributions to the development trunk, including
    sophisticated instruction selection based on declarative machine
    descriptions, auto-tuning techniques, transactional memory, and
    polyhedral loop nest optimizations.

    GCC is the product of hundreds of person-years of work over its 27
    years of existence. This award recognizes the GCC developer
    community for the substantial impact it has had on the programming
    language community and the larger software industry.

2013:
- Awardee: The Coq proof assistant
  Citation: |
    The Coq proof assistant provides a rich environment for
    interactive development of machine-checked formal reasoning.  Coq
    is having a profound impact on research on programming languages
    and systems, making it possible to extend foundational approaches
    to unprecedented levels of scale and confidence, and transfer them
    to realistic programming languages and tools.  It has been widely
    adopted as a research tool by the programming language research
    community, as evidenced by the many papers at SIGPLAN conferences
    whose results have been developed and/or verified in Coq.  It has
    also rapidly become one of the leading tools of choice for
    teaching the foundations of programming languages, with courses
    offered by many leading universities and a growing number of books
    emerging to support them.  Last but not least, these successes
    have helped to spark a wave of widespread interest in dependent
    type theory, the richly expressive core logic on which Coq is
    based.

    As a software system, Coq has been in continuous development for
    over 20 years, a truly impressive feat of sustained,
    research-driven engineering.  The Coq team continues to develop
    the system, bringing significant improvements in expressiveness
    and usability with each new release.

    In short, Coq is playing an essential role in our transition to a
    new era of formal assurance in mathematics, semantics, and program
    verification.

- Awardee: Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow for the Glasgow Haskell compiler
  Citation: |
    "Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow receive the SIGPLAN Software
    Award as the authors of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), which
    is the preeminent lazy functional programming system for industry,
    teaching, and research. GHC has not only provided a language
    implementation, but also established the whole paradigm of lazy
    functional programming and formed the foundation of a large and
    enthusiastic user community. GHC's flexibility has supported
    experimental research on programming language design in areas as
    diverse as monads, generalized algebraic data types, rank-N
    polymorphism, and software transactional memory. Indeed, a large
    share of the research on lazy functional programming in the last
    5-10 years has been carried out with GHC. Simultaneously, GHC's
    reliability and efficiency has encouraged commercial adoption, in
    the financial sector in institutions like Credit Suisse and
    Standard Chartered Bank, and for high assurance software in
    companies like Amgen, Eaton, and Galois.

    A measure of GHC's influence is the way that many of the ideas of
    purely functional, "typeful programming" have been carried into
    newer languages and language features. including C\#, F\#, Java
    Generics, LINQ, Perl 6, Python, and Visual Basic 9.0. Peyton Jones
    and Marlow have been visionary in the way that they have
    transitioned research into practice. They have been role models and
    leaders in creating the large and diverse Haskell community, and
    have made GHC an industrial-strength platform for commercial
    development as well as for research."

- Awardee: Chris Lattner for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure
  Citation: |
    Chris Lattner receives the SIGPLAN Software Award as the author of
    the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, which has had a dramatic impact
    on our field. LLVM is being used extensively in both products and
    research, for traditional and non-traditional compiler problems,
    and for a diverse set of languages. LLVM has had a significant
    influence on academic research, not just in compilers but also in
    other areas, such as FPGA design tool. Many researchers cite the
    "elegance of LLVM's design" as one of the reasons for using LLVM.
    LLVM has also had an impact on industrial projects and products; it
    is used at major companies including Apple and Google. For example,
    LLVM is an integral part of Apple's software stack in Mac OS X.
    Furthermore, as with academic research, LLVM is finding its way
    into unexpected applications of compiler technology. In summary,
    LLVM has had an incredible impact on both industry and academia and
    its elegance has enabled it to be used for a wide range of
    applications."
