  Citation: |
    The paper greatly advanced our ability to synthesize programs from logical
    specifications. It was based on the insight that much of the work carried out
    by a program verifier could be repurposed not just for checking that code
    matches a specification, but also to synthesize code that does. The user
    specifies the input-output behavior as a logical formula, and also provides
    structural and resource constraints, which describe a template language for the
    space of possible programs. In later works, such domain-specific languages
    (DSLs) became the norm for restricting the search space to make synthesis
    tractable. The verifier then scaffolds the synthesized code onto this
    structure, adhering to the prescribed resources. The authors were able to
    synthesize a range of clever algorithms, which served as inspiration for some
    of the massive effort on verification-based program synthesis over the past
    decade.

    (for 2009): _[Compositional shape analysis by means of bi-abduction](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1480917)_
  Citation: |
    Shape Analysis is the problem of precisely predicting, at compile-time, 
    the contents of mutable, pointer-based data structures. It holds the key 
    to identifying, and hence eliminating, a wide variety of classes of 
    software defects, from null-dereference errors, to use-after-free bugs 
    and memory leaks to subtle data races that complicate concurrency. 
    
    This paper showed how to use compositionality to scale shape analysis up  
    to large code bases, by introducing *bi-abduction*: a new technique for 
    analyzing each procedure in isolation, independent of its callees. 
    
    Bi-abduction allows an analysis to determine separation logic 
    *pre-conditions* under which the procedure executes safely, and 
    corresponding *post-conditions* that describe how the procedure mutates 
    the heap when executed from a configuration satisfying the precondition. 
    We can then use separation logic to compose the pre- and post-conditions 
    for different functions, yielding the first precise shape analyses capable 
    of running on millions of lines of code. 
    
    This work directly led to the 
    development of the `Infer` static analyzer which has been used to find 
    and fix tens of thousands of defects across multiple industrial code bases. 
    Further, it rekindled interest in the notion of abduction, leading to new 
    techniques for interactive exploration of the results of static analysis, 
    and compositional program synthesis.

  Citation: |
    Session types are a type-based framework for codifying
    communication structures and verifying protocols in concurrent,
    message-passing programs.  Previously, session types could only
    model binary (two-party) protocols.  This paper generalizes the
    theory to the multiparty case with asynchronous communications,
    preventing deadlock and communication errors in more sophisticated
    communication protocols involving any number (two or more) of
    participants.  The central idea was to introduce global types,
    which describe multiparty conversations from a global perspective
    and provide a means to check protocol compliance.  This work has
    inspired numerous authors to build on its pioneering foundations
    in the session types community and has initiated many applications
    of multiparty session types in programming languages and tools. It
    has also influenced other areas of research, such as software
    contracts, runtime verification and hardware specifications.

  Citation: |
    The selected paper presents one of the earliest models of the
    interaction between the browser and JavaScript. It uses this model
    to work out the formalization and dynamic enforcement of rich
    security policies.  Since then, people have routinely discovered
    additional, pernicious security problems based on this
    model. Eliminating these problems remains an important challenge
    to this day.

    Looking back, the selected paper made a prescient, and
    influential, contribution to understanding these JavaScript-based
    security problems. The authors chose a formal, semantic approach
    to model these problems and potential solutions, while remaining
    true to the complicated characteristics that make both JavaScript
    and the browser real-world artifacts.

  Citation: |
    This paper presents the CompCert compiler, a landmark effort in
    program verification.  The paper was (and still is) groundbreaking
    in that it demonstrates the feasibility of using an interactive
    theorem prover -- specifically, Coq -- to both program and
    formally verify a realistic compiler -- specifically, the backend
    of an optimizing compiler for a significant subset of C.  The
    verification ensures that properties proved about C source code
    continue to hold of the assembly output of the compiler, thereby
    filling a major gap in the development of high-assurance software
    and facilitating a great deal of follow-on work on verified
    software toolchains.  Moreover, CompCert made a convincing case
    that theorem-proving technology is mature enough to be applied to
    the full functional verification of realistic systems, and in so
    doing heralded a new age of "big verification".

  Citation: |
    The "view-update problem" is a classic problem in databases: when
    operating on a partial view of a data structure, how should
    updates to the view be propagated to the original data structure?
    This POPL 2005 paper was instrumental in bringing the view-update
    problem to the attention of the programming languages community
    and demonstrating the broad relevance of the problem beyond
    databases.  The immediate contributions of the paper were (1) to
    introduce a general mathematical space of well-behaved
    bidirectional transformations called "lenses," and (2) to develop
    a specific instantiation of this framework in the form of a
    domain-specific language of combinators for tree transformations,
    which served as the basis for subsequent tools for editing XML and
    HTML.  More broadly, the paper sparked a great deal of follow-on
    work in the area of BX ("bidirectional transformations"), leading
    to a fruitful collaboration between the worlds of databases,
    programming languages, and software engineering.

  Citation: |
    Interpolation can be used to construct an inductive invariant for
    a transition system that is strong enough to prove a given
    property.  Prior to Henzinger et al.'s paper, interpolation had
    only been applied to model checking of finite-state systems.  In
    this paper, the authors demonstrated a fundamental generalization
    of Craig interpolation to program analysis by predicate
    abstraction, opening the door for interpolation to be applied to
    abstraction refinement of infinite-state systems.  This work
    showed how interpolation offers a fundamental way to explain
    abstraction refinement in a logical framework and has led to many
    extensions to increase the power of abstraction in program
    analysis.

  Citation: |
    Languages with automatic memory management offer well-known advantages
    in terms of software engineering, but the use of garbage collection
    seemed for a long time to place such languages off-limits for hard
    real-time and embedded systems.  Indeed, prior to this highly
    influential paper, the existing approaches to real-time garbage
    collection suffered from a number of practical problems: a lack of
    hard bounds on pause times in the face of fragmentation or large data
    structures; high space overhead due to the use of copying collection
    to avoid fragmentation; and uneven mutator utilization due to the use
    of work-based scheduling algorithms.  Bacon, Cheng & Rajan's paper
    showed how to overcome all these problems in the design of a *real*
    real-time garbage collector for Java.  The collector, which was
    implemented and tested in the Jikes RVM, employed an impressive
    variety of techniques, such as time-based scheduling and "mostly
    non-moving" collection, in order to provide guaranteed pause times,
    consistent mutator utilization, and low space overhead.  In short, the
    paper marked a major advance toward the important goal of turning hard
    real-time garbage collection into a reality.

  Citation:
    This paper showed a path to taking legacy C code and
    making it safer, by adding type safety guarantees to
    existing C programs. It uses a combination of static
    and dynamic techniques to allow programmers to conduct
    low-level operations while guaranteeing safety properties
    regarding pointers and minimizing overhead. For many
    C programs, CCured's type inference is able to infer
    that most or all of the pointers are statically verifiable
    to be type safe. This paper demonstrates the beauty of
    both dynamic and static types, influencing the design
    of languages such as C#, and inspiring continuing
    research on static and dynamic analysis.

  Citation: |
    In applying the logic of bunched implications (BI) to mutable data
    structures this paper laid the groundwork for the flowering of
    separation logic (heap models of separation logic are specific BI
    models), which allows reasoning about programs with dynamically
    allocated (and deallocated) memory.  This paper introduced the
    'frame rule' which supports local reasoning in separation logic,
    where specifications and proofs concentrate on just those memory
    cells manipulated by a program component rather than the entire
    global program state.  Separation logic underlies continuing
    research on what is described as local reasoning, having diverse
    application in domains such as program verification and automated
    parallelization.

    also apply to other process calculi (even those without an explicit
    notion of location), so contributing to excitement in an area that
    was growing at that time and continues. The work has led to
    application of concurrency theory in fields as diverse as security,
    safety critical applications, query languages for semistructured
    data, and systems biology.

  Citation: |
    "From System F to Typed Assembly Language" by Greg Morrisett, David
    Walker, Karl Crary, and Neal Glew began a major development in the
    application of type system ideas to low level programming.  The
    paper shows how to compile a high-level, statically typed language
    into TAL, a typed assembly language defined by the authors. The
    type system for the assembly language ensures that source-level
    abstractions like closures and polymorphic functions are enforced
    at the machine-code level while permitting aggressive, low-level
    optimizations such as register allocation and instruction
    scheduling. This infrastructure provides the basis for ensuring the
    safety of untrusted low-level code artifacts, regardless of their
    source.  A large body of subsequent work has drawn on the ideas in
    this paper, including work on proof-carrying code and certifying
    compilers.
