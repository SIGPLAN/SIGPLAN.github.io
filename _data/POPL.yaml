  Citation: |

    Interpolation can be used to construct an inductive invariant for
    a transition system that is strong enough to prove a given
    property.  Prior to Henzinger et al.'s paper, interpolation had
    only been applied to model checking of finite-state systems.  In
    this paper, the authors demonstrated a fundamental generalization
    of Craig interpolation to program analysis by predicate
    abstraction, opening the door for interpolation to be applied to
    abstraction refinement of infinite-state systems.  This work
    showed how interpolation offers a fundamental way to explain
    abstraction refinement in a logical framework and has led to many
    extensions to increase the power of abstraction in program
    analysis.

  Citation: |
    Languages with automatic memory management offer well-known advantages
    in terms of software engineering, but the use of garbage collection
    seemed for a long time to place such languages off-limits for hard
    real-time and embedded systems.  Indeed, prior to this highly
    influential paper, the existing approaches to real-time garbage
    collection suffered from a number of practical problems: a lack of
    hard bounds on pause times in the face of fragmentation or large data
    structures; high space overhead due to the use of copying collection
    to avoid fragmentation; and uneven mutator utilization due to the use
    of work-based scheduling algorithms.  Bacon, Cheng & Rajan's paper
    showed how to overcome all these problems in the design of a *real*
    real-time garbage collector for Java.  The collector, which was
    implemented and tested in the Jikes RVM, employed an impressive
    variety of techniques, such as time-based scheduling and "mostly
    non-moving" collection, in order to provide guaranteed pause times,
    consistent mutator utilization, and low space overhead.  In short, the
    paper marked a major advance toward the important goal of turning hard
    real-time garbage collection into a reality.

    (for 2002) [CCured: Type-Safe Retrofitting of Legacy Code](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1065892)

  Citation:    
    This paper showed a path to taking legacy C code and 
    making it safer, by adding type safety guarantees to 
    existing C programs. It uses a combination of static 
    and dynamic techniques to allow programmers to conduct 
    low-level operations while guaranteeing safety properties 
    regarding pointers and minimizing overhead. For many 
    C programs, CCured&#8217;s type inference is able to infer 
    that most or all of the pointers are statically verifiable 
    to be type safe. This paper demonstrates the beauty of 
    both dynamic and static types, influencing the design 
    of languages such as C#, and inspiring continuing 
    research on static and dynamic analysis.

  Citation: |
    In applying the logic of bunched implications (BI) to mutable data
    structures this paper laid the groundwork for the flowering of
    separation logic (heap models of separation logic are specific BI
    models), which allows reasoning about programs with dynamically
    allocated (and deallocated) memory.  This paper introduced the
    'frame rule' which supports local reasoning in separation logic,
    where specifications and proofs concentrate on just those memory
    cells manipulated by a program component rather than the entire
    global program state.  Separation logic underlies continuing
    research on what is described as local reasoning, having diverse
    application in domains such as program verification and automated
    parallelization.

  Citation: |
    "Anytime, Anywhere: Modal Logics for Mobile Ambients" by Luca
    Cardelli and Andrew D. Gordon helped spur a flowering of work in
    the area of process calculi that continues today. The paper focused
    on modal logics for reasoning about both temporal and spacial
    modalities for ambient behaviours, demonstrating techniques that
    also apply to other process calculi (even those without an explicit
    notion of location), so contributing to excitement in an area that
    was growing at that time and continues. The work has led to
    application of concurrency theory in fields as diverse as security,
    safety critical applications, query languages for semistructured
    data, and systems biology.

    "JFlow: Practical Mostly-Static Information Flow Control" by Andrew
    C. Myers demonstrated the practicality of using static information
    flow analysis to protect privacy and preserve integrity by giving
    an efficient information flow type checker for an extension of the
    widely-used Java language. The work has had a significant impact
    both within and beyond the programming language community. In
    particular, subsequent work for other languages has largely
    followed the path laid out in this paper, and the compiler
    infrastructure developed for JFlow (now called Jif) is widely used
    as a research platform. Furthermore, using the JFlow work as a
    basis, several major research initiatives are investigating the
    challenges of building complex, real-world systems with
    confidentiality guarantees.

  Citation: |    
    "From System F to Typed Assembly Language" by Greg Morrisett, David
    Walker, Karl Crary, and Neal Glew began a major development in the 
    application of type system ideas to low level programming.  The
    paper shows how to compile a high-level, statically typed language
    into TAL, a typed assembly language defined by the authors. The
    type system for the assembly language ensures that source-level
    abstractions like closures and polymorphic functions are enforced
    at the machine-code level while permitting aggressive, low-level
    optimizations such as register allocation and instruction
    scheduling. This infrastructure provides the basis for ensuring the
    safety of untrusted low-level code artifacts, regardless of their
    source.  A large body of subsequent work has drawn on the ideas in
    this paper, including work on proof-carrying code and certifying
    compilers.
