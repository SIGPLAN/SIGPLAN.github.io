    Automated verification of imperative data structures such as lists
    is challenging because of the need to define complex loop
    invariants that have a sensible interpretation in an underlying
    program logic.  This thesis presents a number of foundational
    results that greatly simplify the proof obligations that must be
    provided by the programmer for the verification of such programs.
    Through the introduction and application of concepts such as
    deterministic transitive closure and property-directed
    reachability, the thesis demonstrates the feasibility of using a
    decidable logic (EPR) as an effective basis for answering
    reachability queries on an expressive class of imperative
    list-manipulating programs.  The thesis also extends these
    foundational ideas to define modular principles for reasoning
    about imperative data structures across procedure boundaries.
    These contributions ultimately lead to a system that can
    effectively infer loop invariants from an expressive template
    family using existing SAT solver and shape analysis technology.
    Collectively, these results lead to a thesis that makes very
    important foundational and practical contributions to our
    understanding of the potential of automated program verification
    and its application to real-world programs.

  Advisor: Stephanie Weirich
  Citation: |
    This work represents a major step toward the holy grail of
    "general-purpose dependently typed programming" -- i.e., the
    design of programming languages that allow programs to be written
    using the full spectrum of standard features and idioms while,
    supporting machine-checked correctness proofs for these programs,
    expressed in the very same language. Such languages, combining the
    logical power of full-spectrum dependent languages such as Coq and
    Agda with the convenience and expressiveness of mainstream
    functional languages and supporting "lightweight verification"
    targeting just the most important properties of the most critical
    parts of the code, have been imagined for decades, but realizing
    this dream has proved technically challenging. The language and
    its accompanying metatheory introduce two important
    innovations. The first, and more technical, of these is the design
    of a core language combining a call-by-value evaluation order, a
    pragmatically motivated treatment of computational irrelevance (to
    support compilation to efficient machine code), and a novel
    treatment of propositional equality. The second is a new approach
    to surface-language design, where two terms (including proof
    terms) are considered to be equivalent if one can be rewritten to
    the other by applying a set of "known equalities" arising from
    previous definitions, which is quite convenient and intuitive for
    programmers. This beautiful thesis will be a cornerstone of a new
    generation of language designs supporting significantly more
    robust and reliable software development.

    _[The C11 and C++11 Concurrency Model](/Awards/Dissertation/2015_batty.pdf)_
  Advisor: Peter Sewell
  Citation: |
    Mark Batty's dissertation makes significant contributions to the
    understanding of memory models for C and C++.  The ISO C++
    committee proposed a design for C and C++ concurrency that was not
    up to the task of capturing a realistic relaxed-memory concurrency
    model. Batty's work uncovered a number of subtle and serious flaws
    in the design, and produced an improved design in completely
    rigorous and machine-checked mathematics. Using software tools to
    explore the consequences of the design, derived directly from the
    mathematics, it showed that it has the desired behavior on many
    examples, and developed mechanized proofs that the design meets
    some of the original goals, showing that for programs in various
    subsets of the language one can reason in simpler models. The
    standards committee have adopted this work in their C11, C++11,
    and C++14 standards. The members of the award committee were
    impressed with the quality of the work, the impact it has had on
    the standardization process for C++, and the clarity of the
    presentation.

  Other: |
    _[Understanding and Expressing Scalable Concurrency](/Awards/Dissertation/2014_turon.pdf)_
  Advisor: Mitchell Wand
  Citation: |
    Aaron Turon's dissertation makes several major contributions to
    the design, implementation, and verification of scalable
    concurrent programs.  First, the dissertation presents "reagents",
    a high-level language of combinators for designing---and
    *composing*---lock-free data structures.  Second, the dissertation
    shows how lock-free data structures can be used to scalably
    implement Fournet and Gonthier's join calculus, in a newly
    re-engineered C# library that significantly outperforms prior
    lock-based implementations.  Third, the dissertation develops
    powerful theoretical foundations---based on logical relations and
    separation logic---for verifying the correctness of scalable
    concurrent algorithms via contextual refinement.  The members of
    the award committee were impressed with both the breadth and depth
    of the work, as well as the elegance of the exposition.

  Advisor: Ranjit Jhala
  Citation: |
    Patrick Rondon’s dissertation makes several significant
    contributions to the field of automatic program verification.  It
    takes a type system -- a highly scalable yet not quite precise
    method of dealing with programs -- and refines it using
    Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) techniques to compensate for
    the precision loss.  There are implementations for both OCaml and
    C.  The achieved degree of effectiveness and automation is
    astonishing: programs that are beyond the existing verification
    tools can be handled fully automatically within seconds.  It
    demonstrates that formal verification can yield significant
    reliability guarantees for mainstream software engineering, at a
    reasonable cost.  In addition, the thesis contains a comprehensive
    formalization with very detailed, readable proofs.  The members of
    the award committee were impressed by the quality of the work and
    the clarity of the presentation.

  Advisor: Todd Millstein
  Citation: |
    This dissertation addresses the problem of obtaining reliable
    results from concurrent programs. As a first step, the
    dissertation presents LiteRace, which uses sampling to dynamically
    detect race conditions. As a second step, the dissertation
    presents DRFx, which is a memory model that enforces sequential
    consistency, where hardware and software share responsibility for
    detecting violations of sequential consistency. Finally, the
    dissertation presents the design of an optimizing compiler that
    preserves sequential consistency. The dissertation thus
    demonstrates how a revised distribution of responsibilities among
    programmers, programming languages, and hardware can help detect
    and avoid concurrency violations. The committee was impressed with
    the dissertation's broad vision for both the problems of
    concurrency and the possible solutions.

  Advisor: Vikram Adve
  Citation: |
    This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
    field of parallel and concurrent programming. The main technical
    contribution is a type and effect system that enables reasoning
    about non-interference at a fine granularity. A second
    contribution is support for non-deterministic code sections that
    are explicitly marked as such. A third contribution is support for
    object-oriented frameworks, where user extensions are guaranteed
    to adhere to the framework's effect restrictions. These
    contributions are backed by formal models, soundness proofs, and
    the Deterministic Parallel Java implementation. Evaluation shows
    that highly satisfactory speedups can be achieved on interesting
    code bases, sometimes beating the performance of hand-crafted
    implementations. The members of the award committee were impressed
    by the quality of the work and the clarity of the presentation.

  Advisor: Thomas Reps
  Citation: |
    This dissertation develops improvements to interprocedural program
    analysis through context-bounded analysis and through Lal's
    extended weighted push down systems, which generalize weighted
    push down systems to handle local variables. The dissertation
    describes both algorithms and experiments, and it shows, for
    example, a 30-fold speedup over existing algorithms for analyzing
    concurrent programs. The members of the award committee were
    impressed by the unusual scope and depth of the dissertation and
    its excellent presentation.

  Citation: |
    This dissertation describes the StreamIt synchronous dataflow
    language, for which Thies led the definition. The language
    supports several novel constructs, notably teleport
    messaging. Thies's dissertation includes a technique for
    processing compressed video data, and it also describes dynamic
    analysis techniques to convert legacy C applications to streaming
    applications. The members of the award committee were impressed
    with the novelty, interdisciplinary nature, and breadth of the
    work, the care given to evaluation, and the quality of the

  Advisor: Kathryn McKinley
  Citation: |
    This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
    problems of tracking down and tolerating software errors in
    deployed systems. It proposes a variety of techniques, ranging
    from a breakthrough, probabilistic method of compactly
    representing calling contexts, to novel techniques for tracking
    null pointers, to garbage collector modifications that let
    programs tolerate memory leaks. The evaluation committee was
    impressed by Michael's fresh perspective on these problems and the
    thorough experimental evaluation by which he backs up his
    claims. His research has already had broad adoption and impact,
    and we believe that his techniques will be brought to bear on a
    wide range of future applications.

  Advisor: Alan Mycroft and Matthew Parkinson
  Citation: |
    This dissertation introduces a novel logic for reasoning about
    concurrent shared-memory programs. This logic subsumes both
    rely/guarantee reasoning and separation logic in an elegant and
    natural manner. The dissertation establishes the semantic
    properties of the logic and demonstrates its applicability on a
    range of highly complex concurrent algorithms and data structures.
    The evaluation committee found the clarity of Viktor's
    presentation and the technical depth of his results particularly
    compelling, and we believe that this work creates a foundation for
    new tools and automated techniques for reasoning about concurrent
    programs.

  Citation: |
    The thesis explores a formalism called nested trees, that can
    represent complex branching behavior (loops and recursion) and
    support modular statement of context-sensitive correctness
    conditions. It further makes a specific technical contribution by
    offering the first algorithm for reachability in in nested trees
    that is sub-cubic in performance. The committee believes this work
    has great potential for long-term utility.

    _[Fault Location via Dynamic Slicing](/Awards/Dissertation/2006_zhang.pdf)_
  Advisor: Rajiv Gupta
  Citation: |
    Dynamic slicing is a technique for determining which variables and
    data structures affected values causing a fault (bug) at a
    particular location in a particular run of a program, thus
    allowing a programmer to work backwards to determine the ultimate
    cause of a fault. Previously this approach was too expensive to
    use in practice. Zhang has improved the performance by orders of
    magnitude, making it practical. The committee believes this work
    will have considerable impact and value in practice.
