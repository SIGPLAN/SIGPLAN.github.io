    Eduardo Geraldo’s PhD work combines static and dynamic analysis to
    develop a value-dependent approach to information flow control to
    enable the detection of information leaks in Java programs that if
    detected could compromise data confidentiality.

  Awardee: "Junwen Yang, University of Chicago"
  Citation: |
    Junwen Yang’s PhD work illuminates and addresses performance
    problems that affect applications that use Object Relational
    Mapping (ORM) frameworks as the interface to databases. The work
    uses profiling and repository mining to study performance issues
    in open-source projects, and generalizes them into a small suite
    of performance anti-patterns. It then presents static analyses to
    help programmers identify and resolve performance problems. The
    analyses suggest semantics-preserving refactorings when possible,
    but also allow programmers to tradeoff functionality for
    performance if necessary. The evaluation shows that this work is
    usable by programmers, uncovers hundreds of previously unknown
    performance problems, and can lead to significant performance
    gains.

- Award: John Vlissides Award
  Awardee: "Silvia Grewe, Technische Universität Darmstadt"
  Citation: |
    Silvia Grewe's work aims to provide better automation of type
    soundness proofs for new languages, thus lowering the barrier to
    developing sound general-purpose and domain-specific languages.
    Theorem-proving systems are increasingly adept at automating
    proofs, and soundness proofs based on progress and preservation
    seem especially ripe for automation due to patterns that appear in
    the proofs, but theorem-proving systems currently lack tactics to
    directly support such proofs. Silvia is working to extract proof
    patterns and integrate them into theorem provers to make
    automation more effective and accessible.

  Awardee: "Chang Liu, University of Maryland"
  Citation: |
    Chang Liu's work explores programming language support for
    oblivious applications, an important dimension of security in the
    presence of side channels. His work bridges two disjoint efforts
    on opposite ends of the hardware-software design spectrum --
    oblivious RAM and oblivious algorithms -- and adopts a language
    design approach to facilitate users in their development of
    efficient oblivious applications. The new language is endowed with
    a type system providing formal guarantees of obliviousness, and
    can support both sequential and parallel applications. The
    promising approach Chang proposed may significantly improve
    development productivity and performance of oblivious
    applications.

- Award: John Vlissides Award
  Awardee: "Christopher Hall, UC Santa Barbara"
  Citation: |
    Christopher Hall's work explores the classic design tension
    between user friendly versus expert friendly user interface design
    as well as the classic design tension between binary versus
    printable data format design. His work sets out to expose both
    sets of design tensions as having the same cause and
    solution. Information representations and user interface
    architecture both lack a self descriptive capacity.  By raising
    the common denominator of computing to a foundation that is
    metadata friendly, structured editing can place human-readable
    strings and graphical user interfaces on the same
    spectrum. Smoothing out the gradients of interacting with
    computation creates new opportunities for unifying software
    systems as a developer and having an outlet for accruing and
    applying computational literacy as an end-user.

  Awardee: "Zalia Shams, Virginia Tech"
  Citation: |
    Zalia Shams' work is motivated by the observation that software
    testing is frequently being added to programming courses at many
    schools, but current assessment techniques for evaluating
    student-written software tests are imperfect.  Code coverage
    measures are typically used in practice, but that approach does
    not assess how much of the expected behavior is checked by the
    tests and sometimes overestimates the true quality of the
    tests. Running one student’s tests against others’ code (known as
    all-pairs testing) and mutation analysis are better indicators of
    test quality but both of them posed a number of practical
    obstacles to classroom use.  Her proposal describes technical
    obstacles behind using these two approaches in automated
    grading. Zalia has provided novel and practical solutions to apply
    all-pairs testing and mutation analysis of student-written tests,
    especially in an automated grading context.

2011:
- Award: John Vlissides Award
  Awardee: "Hari K. Pyla, Virginia Tech"
  Citation: |
    Hari Pyla's work is motivated by the need to leverage concurrency
    to achieve performance, and the challenge of avoiding deadlocks in
    concurrent shared memory programs. He has introduced Sammati, a
    new approach that transparently and deterministically detects and
    recovers from deadlocks, without requiring modification to source
    code. This approach not only avoids errors, but also allows more
    effective composition of lock-based code. Hari's system also
    supports coarse-grained speculative parallelism, supporting
    difficult-to-parallelize applications and achieving significant
    speedups in practice.

  Awardee: "M&#225;rcio Ribeiro, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)"
  Citation: |
    M&#225;rcio Ribeiro's research addresses the problem of
    maintaining software defined using "virtual separation of
    concerns." The virtual separation of concerns technique presents
    software with features defined using code between \#ifdef and
    \#endif (as in the C preprocessor) to the programmer in a way that
    hides various features that are not of immediate
    interest. However, when maintaining such software, it is easy to
    break code in hidden features. The solution approach uses a
    specialized dataflow analysis that takes features and allowed
    feature combinations into account. The results of this analysis
    are used to warn the programmer if there are dependencies between
    the changed code and any hidden features. These ideas are being
    implemented in a tool that will allow independent development of
    parallel features.

  Awardee: "Tudor Dumitras, Carnegie Mellon University"
  Citation: |
    Tudor Dumitras's research identifies and addresses the leading
    causes of both unplanned failures and planned downtime resulting
    from software upgrades in distributed systems. Traditional
    fault-tolerance approaches concentrate almost entirely on
    responding to, avoiding, or tolerating unexpected faults or
    security violations. However, scheduled events such as software
    upgrades account for most system unavailability and often
    introduce data loss or latent errors. Tudor defines three abstract
    properties required for improving the dependability of software
    upgrades.  Building on empirically derived insights on current
    upgrade practices and problems, Tudor's work harnesses the
    opportunities provided by emerging technologies such as cloud
    computing to simplify large-scale upgrades, to allow upgrades to
    be executed efficiently online, and to improve their
    dependability.

- Award: John Vlissides Award
  Awardee: "Ciera Jaspan, Carnegie Mellon University"
  Citation: |
    Ciera Jaspan's research targets the programming difficulties
    associated with using software frameworks. Plug-in writers need to
    satisfy a variety of framework constraints, and Ciera is directly
    motivated by the kinds of plug-in errors that frequently arise in
    today's frameworks. She has defined a new abstraction for
    expressing framework constraints as well as lightweight
    annotations and an associated static analysis to enforce this
    abstraction.  Ciera is focused on making the right tradeoffs to
    ensure her solution is useful in practice.
