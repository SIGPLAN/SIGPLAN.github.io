    (for 2012) _[Test-Case Reduction for C Compiler Bugs](https://doi.org/10.1145/2254064.2254104)_
  Citation: |
    Finding small, valid, C programs that trigger C compiler bugs is
    hard. Distilling a bug-causing compiler input to its essence was
    previously a largely manual process assisted by delta
    debugging. This work enhanced delta debugging with new techniques
    for generating valid (without undefined behavior) test variants,
    including pluggable program transformations that perform reduction
    operations to produce tests 25 times smaller than previous
    schemes. The paper influenced the broader testing and fuzzing
    communities beyond compiler testing by reinforcing the importance
    of domain-specific transformers for test case reduction and in
    seed generation for fuzzing.

    (for 2011) _[Finding and understanding bugs in C compilers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1993316.1993532)_
  Citation: |
    The paper tackles head-on the difficult problem of automatically finding 
    miscompilation bugs in compilers for unsafe languages such as C.  Based 
    on a clever combination of scalable static analysis at generation-time, 
    and dynamic checks at run-time, the paper contributes a method for random 
    generation of C programs that are guaranteed to be free from undefined 
    behavior when they execute, yet are still interesting enough that they 
    have a good chance of exposing compiler bugs that corrupt these results.  
    These programs can be used to find bugs via cross-checking results across 
    multiple compilers, and are implemented in the Csmith tool which, at the 
    time of the paper, was used to find hundreds of bugs in 11 different C 
    compilers, including the widely-used open source GCC and LLVM compilers.  
    Csmith revolutionized the field of compiler testing, inspiring and influencing 
    a large body of work that has seen broad uptake by industry, including many 
    practical compiler testing tools for C and many other languages, including 
    C++, OpenCL, CUDA and Verilog.

  Citation: |
    The PLDI 2010 paper “Green: A Framework for Supporting
    Energy-Conscious Programming using Controlled Approximation” by
    Woongki Baek and Trishul Chilimbi demonstrated conclusively two
    important things: (1) that frameworks supporting approximations that
    trade energy/performance costs for quality of service could be
    generalized and automated, and (2) applying this approach in data
    center search workloads could result in significant energy reduction
    and cost, saving millions of dollars in practice.  Green proved that
    systematic approaches to approximate computing could have enormous
    commercial impact and predated and informed many subsequent machine
    learning optimizations, such as using reduced precision arithmetic in
    deep learning models.  Green also inspired subsequent efforts, to more
    deeply encode approximation semantics into the underlying programming
    language design.

    (for 2009) _[FastTrack: Efficient and Precise Dynamic Race Detection](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1542490)_
  Citation: |
    FastTrack had both an immediate and a permanent impact on how dynamic data-race 
    detection is done.  Prior work either used lock-set algorithms for performance 
    despite false positives or were slow due to algorithms that required space 
    proportional to the number of threads times the size of the heap and read/write 
    operations that took time proportional to the number of threads.  FastTrack 
    contributed an algorithm and implementation that was truly the best of both 
    worlds in most cases: a set of a natural and elegant choices for optimizing 
    data structures and algorithms for dynamic data-race detection leads to a system 
    that is as fast as lock-set algorithms whenever lock-set algorithms would not 
    produce false positives but that gracefully falls back to slower approaches 
    for objects where lock-set algorithms would lead to false positives.  In both 
    theory and practice, the FastTrack algorithm became the baseline against which 
    all subsequent dynamic data-race detectors are judged.

  Citation: |
    The PLDI 2008 paper "A Practical Automatic Polyhedral Parallelizer and
    Locality Optimizer" significantly advanced the power and practical automatic
    application of polyhedral analysis to automatically determine parallelism
    and locality improving affine transforms of regular programs expressed as
    sequences of possibly imperfect loops. The work presented in this paper
    produced practical implementations that could automatically generate OpenMP
    parallel programs from sequential nested loops written in C. This inspired a
    large number of other researchers to further develop polyhedral
    optimizations based on this approach, like automatic code generation for
    GPUs and FPGA circuits by high level synthesis from nested sequential
    loops. The ideas in this paper have proved to be enduring and widely
    applicable and even to this day keep finding new applications, e.g., for
    mapping machine learning algorithms to specialized accelerators.

  Citation: |
    Valgrind is a framework for writing dynamic binary instrumentation
    tools, which interleave the execution of program monitoring code
    with the execution of a program itself. The best known tool built
    with Valgrind is Memcheck, which detects uses of undefined values
    down to the bit level. Other tools track "tainted" or special
    (e.g., password) values. Valgrind facilitates the construction of
    these tools by abstracting the details of complex computer
    architectures and providing an expressive interface for writing
    instrumenting code. Valgrind pioneered dynamic binary
    recompilation for tight integration and optimization of
    instrumentation code. The paper contains a careful analysis of the
    requirements of dynamic binary instrumentation tools and shows
    that competing tools, unlike Valgrind, sacrifice completeness of
    features for simplicity of implementation, use, or
    performance. The paper is widely cited. Many open-source defect
    detection tools build on Valgrind and have improved a wide range
    of open-source and commercial software.

  Citation: |
    The PLDI 2006 "DieHard" paper by Emery Berger and Benjamin Zorn
    introduced the concept of probabilistic memory safety (for unsafe
    languages such as C/C++) through three main techniques: (1)
    randomization of object placement in the heap; (2)
    overprovisioning of the heap to provide expected gaps between
    objects; (3) optional replication of processes to enable even
    greater fault tolerance.  This approach was shown to provide
    protection against a variety of memory errors, including dangling
    pointers and buffer overflows, as formalized mathematically and
    evaluated empirically. By fully randomizing heap object locations
    in memory -- effectively pushing address-space layout
    randomization to the individual object level -- DieHard also makes
    systems more resilient to attack. Variations of DieHard were
    implemented on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.  The Windows
    implementation directly influenced the Fault Tolerant Heap of
    Windows 7 and the Windows 8 user-mode heap allocator.

  Citation: |
    This paper introduced Pin, a dynamic binary instrumentation
    framework that enables the creation of dynamic program analysis
    tools.  Pin uses dynamic compilation to instrument executables and
    dynamically-linked libraries while they are running, permitting
    the tool writer to study the behavior of an application at the
    instruction level without significant perturbation to application
    behavior.  The PLDI 2005 paper is highly cited and the system it
    describes is in widespread use in academia and industry.  Pin's
    ease of use and relative efficiency have made it the tool of
    choice for dynamic binary instrumentation.

  Citation: |
    This is the first publication to describe the design,
    implementation, and optimization of the language nesC, which is a
    variant of the C programming language especially well suited to
    the programming of embedded systems.  Much as the C programming
    language made possible the development of UNIX, so has nesC made
    possible the development of TinyOS.  A decade hence, nesC is still
    the language of choice for developing applications under TinyOS on
    "motes" and other embedded systems platforms.  Central to the
    design of nesC and TinyOS is the notion of an asynchronous, or
    non-blocking, call.  This form of software architecture nicely
    accommodates the timing uncertainties and failures experienced by
    embedded systems applications in the real world.  The success and
    longevity of nesC can be attributed to its precise and useful
    formulations of concurrency, atomicity, and modularization with
    regard to its intended application audience.  These formulations
    allow for efficient implementations while offering encapsulation
    mechanisms that encourage software sharing and reuse.  The nesC
    paper has amassed hundreds of citations, and the language
    continues to be in widespread use for teaching, research, and
    industry in the embedded systems community.

  Citation: |
    Dynamo pioneered the technique of monitoring, analyzing, and
    optimizing binary code on-the-fly while the program executes,
    without relying on any program modifications, compiler hints,
    profile data from prior runs, or special purpose hardware. Contrary
    to intuition, one could use Dynamo to substantially improve the
    performance of a binary's execution, even when it was generated by
    a state-of-the-art optimizing compiler. By continuously monitoring
    its own overhead, Dynamo could suspend itself (and resume later)
    when the optimization gains were not sufficient to offset the cost
    of its own operation. The ability for a software-only system to
    speed up a program binary without any kind of modification or
    externally provided hints challenged much entrenched thinking at
    the time, and catalyzed a rethinking of the compiler-architecture
    interface. Hardware designs were shifting more of the performance
    optimization burden from the hardware to the compiler. At the same
    time software was moving towards greater use of dynamic binding,
    resulting in a shrinking optimization scope for the compiler. These
    two trends were in tension with one another. By operating at binary
    execution time, Dynamo helped bridge this growing gap by
    complementing the compiler's traditional strength in static control
    flow based optimization with instruction-level runtime trace-based
    optimization. This paper was the first in a series of publications
    that continue to this day on similar trace-based systems for
    dynamic binary optimization, dynamic binary instrumentation, and
    dynamic binary translation.

  Citation: |
    The 1999 PLDI paper "A Fast Fourier Transform Compiler" by Matteo
    Frigo describes the implementation of *genfft*, a special-purpose
    compiler that produces the performance critical code for a library,
    called FFTW (the "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West"), that
    computes the discrete Fourier transform. FFTW is the predominant
    open fast Fourier transform package available today, as it has been
    since its introduction a decade ago. *genfft* demonstrated the
    power of domain-specific compilation -- FFTW achieves the best or
    close to best performance on most machines, which is remarkable for
    a single package. By encapsulating expert knowledge from the FFT
    algorithm domain and the compiler domain, *genfft* and FFTW provide
    a tremendous service to the scientific and technical community by
    making highly efficient FFTs available to everyone on any machine.
    As well as being the fastest FFT in the West, FFTW may be the last
    FFT in the West as the quality of this package and the maturity of
    the field may mean that it will never be superseded, at least for
    computer architectures similar to past and current ones.

    The 1998 PLDI paper "Implementation of the Cilk-5 Multithreaded

    Randall introduced an efficient form of thread-local deques to
    control scheduling of multithreaded programs. This innovation not
    only opened the way to faster and simpler runtimes for fine-grained
    parallelism, but also provided a basis for simpler parallel
    recursive programming techniques that elegantly extend those of
    sequential programming. The stack-like side of a deque acts just
    like a standard procedure stack, while the queue side enables
    breadth-first work-stealing by other threads. The work-stealing
    techniques introduced in this paper are beginning to influence
    common practice, such as the Intel Threading Building Blocks
    project, an upcoming standardized fork-join framework for Java, and
    a variety of projects at Microsoft.
