  Citation: |
     1ML – Core and Modules United (F-ing First-Class Modules) is a milestone in the understanding of the ML module system, uniting core and modules in a simple calculus that clarified long-standing questions in language design. As the culmination of a long line of research dating back to MacQueen’s original design, it has shaped both the theoretical foundations and practical evolution of modular programming. Its lasting impact is clear in its continued readership: it remains the most frequently downloaded ICFP paper from the ACM Digital Library, with more than 1,100 downloads to date and nearly 300 in the past year alone.

    This paper integrated refinement types in Haskell through the proposal of Liquid Types, a specific form of refinement types that balance expressiveness with decidability. Liquid Types provide a practical and powerful tool for ensuring program correctness. The paper has had significant impact on both academic research and practical programming, inspiring further work on refinement types in other languages and in applications such as program synthesis and software contracts.

  Citation: |
    This paper drew the attention of the ICFP community to handlers as
    an abstraction for effectful computation. In exposition, and in
    providing the first operational semantics for handlers & effects,
    and an effect system, it seeded many subsequent
    works. Pragmatically, it detailed implementation of handlers in
    Haskell, and outlined the ideas behind OCaml, SML, and Racket
    implementations, as well as providing experimental results
    comparing handlers with equivalent monadic code.

  Citation: |
    This paper is among the first to describe covert channels caused
    by termination and timing in concurrent programs, and it presents
    a mitigation strategy. It has received attention in the general
    security community, beyond the usual range of ICFP papers. There
    are several follow up papers that build on its insights and extend
    the results to more general settings. It presents a dynamic
    information control flow system that eliminates termination and
    internal timing covert channels, while mitigating external timing,
    all without relying on cooperative scheduling. It achieves this by
    running potentially sensitive actions in separate threads. The
    system is implemented as a Haskell library using labeled
    concurrency primitives, and demonstrated in an example server-side
    web application framework with untrusted client applications
    sharing a persistent key-value store, showing how the library
    addresses potential timing and termination leaks.

  Citation: |
    This is the first conference paper in a highly influential line of
    work creating a bridge between PL and networking. The authors
    analyzed deficiencies in the state of the art in languages for
    programming networks, addressed these limitations in a new
    language design, and described its implementation and performance
    on a suite of microbenchmarks. The language applied a range of
    ideas from the functional programming community: a declarative
    query language for classifying and aggregating network traffic; a
    reactive combinator library for describing high-level
    packet-forwarding policies; and a run-time system that
    automatically generates the low-level packet-processing rules,
    installing, uninstalling, and querying them on physical switches.
    This paper inspired a mountain of follow-on work by these authors
    and others. The practical value of improving network programming,
    and this paper's influence on subsequent advances in the state of
    the art, make it a deserving winner of the award for Most
    Influential Paper of ICFP 2011.

  Citation: |
    The idea is to systematically go from a high-level program semantics
    to a nondeterministic finite-state machine that can be implemented not
    only efficiently but in a relatively straightforward manner.

    The paper showed how this works for a wide variety of language
    constructs such as mutable state, first-class continuations and
    laziness, and how careful choices lead to analyses with tunable
    computational complexity.

    A key advantage of the approach is that ideas from programming
    language design and implementation can be directly imported and
    applied to the design and implementation of abstract interpreters.

    The approach has influenced static analyses for Erlang, JavaScript and
    other languages, and it has influenced many researchers who work on
    sound static analyses.

  Citation: |
    One may think that purely functional programs should run well on parallel 
    hardware without much extra effort. But, at the time the paper was published 
    it had proved hard to realize this potential in practice. This state of the 
    affairs changed with the work presented in the paper. Due to this work, 
    runtime multicore support is one of the GHC's unique features today. The 
    language and runtime make it very simple to exploit degrees of parallelism. 
    The multicore support features are widely used in real-world Haskell - the 
    package implementing the multicore support is itself downloaded widely and 
    most of Haskell's top packages that are widely used in web-servers and web 
    frameworks make use of some form of GHC's parallel and concurrent runtime. 
    Thanks to the multicore support, Haskell is perhaps one of the few languages, 
    where STM is actually widely used in practice. Overall, the paper has a strong 
    case for helping make and cement the case for why functional programming is 
    a happy match for the multicore era.

  Citation: |
    This paper describes how adding parametricity to higher-order abstract
    syntax yields a powerful tool for simplifying proofs of programming-language
    metatheorems.  Specifically, parametricity simplifies both the treatment of
    variables and contexts, and also the proofs of associated lemmas such as
    weakening and substitution.The paper applies the technique, known as PHOAS,
    to machine-checked proofs in Coq. This spurred many follow-on papers on
    syntax representation, mechanized metatheory, and certified
    compilation. Washburn and Weirich introduced a similar (but not identical)
    encoding for Haskell first, which inspired an implementation compatible with
    proof assistants that use dependent type theory. A key benefit of PHOAS is
    avoiding any modeling of contexts, for many worthwhile examples. A recent
    application is the fast, PHOAS-verified crypto code that is used by Chrome,
    which is the world's most popular web browser.

  Citation: |
    The ICFP paper describes Ott's goals and design, focusing
    particularly on its metalanguage, which aims to balance
    mathematical precision and ease-of-use. Ott strikes a balance
    between informal notation and checked structure that is both
    lightweight and powerful. As its syntax is notationally close to
    existing vernacular, it is easy for language designers to
    adopt. At the same time, Ott's flexible parser and native support
    for meta-functions and relations means that it "type checks"
    language specifications, catching subtle errors in definitions
    even without full encoding in a proof assistant. Over the past ten
    years, ICFP researchers have benefitted tremendously from the
    open-source tool and the effective design space exploration that
    it promotes.

    (for 2006) _[Simple unification-based type inference for GADTs](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1159811)_
  Citation: |
    GADTs are a simple but powerful generalization of the recursive
    algebraic datatypes introduced in Hope and a central feature of
    functional programming languages like ML and Haskell.  GADTs have
    become an important technique in the programmer's toolbox,
    enabling a lightweight style of dependently typed programming,
    similar to the use of inductive families.  However, type inference
    is difficult for GADTs, as they necessarily entail the loss of
    principal types.  This paper shows how to exploit a few type
    annotations in order to make inference possible again. The key
    innovation is the notion of "wobbly types".  It has started a
    lively line of research in new approaches to combining type
    inference and type checking - in particular with System FC, an
    extension of System F with constraints, that has provided a simple
    yet powerful internal language for the GHC compiler - and made
    many of the benefits of dependent types accessible to more
    mainstream programmers.

  Citation: |
    Building on the 2005 POPL Paper "Associated types with class",
    Chakravarty, Keller, and Peyton Jones added the ability to write
    open type functions directly in Haskell.  The new opportunities
    for computation on the type level have become popular with Haskell
    programmers, and it would be hard to overstate the influence of
    this work on the community.  Of greatest influence have been these
    three contributions to type-level programming:

      * Type-level functions offer a qualitative jump in the
        expressiveness of Haskell's type system, adding some of the
        advantages of dependently typed languages while retaining
        pervasive type inference.

      * Associated types give type classes a functional notation for
        enabling one type to depend on another.  As opposed to the
        relational notation provided by functional dependencies,
        associated types enable programmers to use the same style of
        programming at the type level that they do at the term level,
        making type-level programming more accessible.

      * The supporting language extension includes a type-level
        equality constraint, which supports the non-injective nature of
        type-functions.  This extension has had many serendipitous
        uses, including in the surprisingly expressive low-level
        intermediate language System FC.

  Citation: |
    In their TLDI 2003 paper, Lämmel and Peyton Jones introduced
    "Scrap Your Boilerplate" (SYB), a simple but powerful design
    pattern for generic programming in Haskell.  SYB introduced a
    library of strategic combinators which one could use to compose
    generic custom traversals of complex data structures, such as
    syntax trees or XML documents.  It was not initially clear,
    however, whether SYB would scale to handle more traditional
    applications of generic programming, such as serialization,
    deserialization, and generic equality, which require a form of
    reflection.  The authors' subsequent ICFP 2004 paper significantly
    extended their original SYB library with support for reflection,
    zips, and generalised casts, thus demonstrating the applicability
    of SYB to a much broader range of generic programming tasks.  This
    broad applicability, combined with the ease with which programmers
    could pick up and use the library, led to its adoption in numerous
    Haskell developments, and contributed greatly to the burgeoning
    interest in statically typed, practically usable libraries for
    generic programming over the past decade.

  Citation: |
    Le Botlan and Rémy's paper on MLF presented a major technical
    breakthrough in type inference for first-class
    polymorphism. Remarkably, by going from ML to a system that is
    more expressive than System F, principal types could be
    recovered. The paper was the first and only paper (to date) to
    present a type inference and unification algorithm with all the
    "good" features of ordinary ML inference and unification, except
    on a richer universe of types and constraints that allowed
    impredicative instantiation. The MLF system enjoys most general
    unifiers, completeness properties, and robustness under program
    transformations, with user type annotations providing the oracles
    needed to reach the expressiveness of System F and beyond. The MLF
    paper has been highly influential on subsequent work in type
    inference for first-class polymorphism, and is a must-read for
    anyone interested in the topic.

    Assertion-based contracts have proven very useful for dynamically

    higher-order functions. Findler and Felleisen's paper filled this
    gap, presenting "the first assertion-based contract checker for
    languages with higher-order functions." The paper also spawned a
    great deal of follow-on work on such topics as the semantics of
    blame assignment and the integration of static typing and dynamic
    contract checking. Higher-order contracts have become a central
    component of the Racket (formerly PLT Scheme) system -- one of the
    major software artifacts of the functional-programming community
    -- which serves as both a research testbed and an effective tool
    for programming-language education.

    Various attempts at extending ML modules with recursions were made

    issue later dubbed the "double-vision problem" by Derek Dreyer. Russo's
    ICFP 2001 paper was the first to propose a correct and practical solution
    to this problem. The solution played very cleverly on the nonstandard
    formalization of ML modules developed in his thesis. Building on this
    novel insight, the ICFP 2001 paper develops a complete design for
    recursive modules in ML, which Russo implemented in Moscow ML and which
    is complete enough to handle many desirable examples. Russo's design was
    the main source of inspiration for adding recursive modules in OCaml,
    taking recursive modules from an open research issue to a realised
    language feature that simply works.

    Malcolm Wallace and Colin Runciman's 1999 ICFP paper "Haskell and

    first papers to spell out the close connection between functional
    programming languages and XML. It described a typed correspondence
    between XML's document type definitions (DTD) and Haskell
    datatypes. This correspondence leads to a natural representation of
    XML data in functional languages and permits native functions to
    operate on this representation. The paper also describes a generic
    encoding of XML trees together with a combinator language for
    querying and transforming the XML. The paper led to a widespread
    awareness of the close connection between XML and functional
    programming and initiated a flurry of research on functional XML
    processing. Moreover,
    the accompanying implementation was widely distributed as part of a
    CD with various XML tools, thus making an impact in the problem
    domain beyond the functional programming community: a perfect

    Lennart Augustsson's 1998 ICFP Paper "Cayenne: A language with

    use of dependent types and in its adoption of an undecidable type
    system. Although the idea seemed quite radical at the time, it
    allowed future work to break out of the straight-jacket of
    decidable type systems. It also pointed the way towards the merger
    of programming languages and proof systems that we are starting to
    see today in languages such as Agda.

    "Functional Reactive Animation" by Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak was
    the first published paper on functional reactive programming. It
    described a collection of data types and functions that comprised
    an embedded domain-specific language called Fran for composing
    interactive, multi-media animations. The key abstractions were
    first-class behaviors and events. Intuitively, a behavior is a
    value that varies with continuous time while an event is a discrete
    counterpart including time-varying predicates. The idea of
    regarding the entire lifetime of a time-varying quantity as a
    single first-class value was new and very surprising at the time,
    but the paper made it seem simple and obvious. The insight in the
    paper led to a significant number of follow-on projects including
    FranTk, Fruit, Pidgets, FrTime, Frob, FRP, Frappe, Frag, Fvision,
    Yampa, Feris, and work on embodying financial contracts in

  Citation: |
    Julia Lawall and Harry Mairson's 1996 ICFP paper "Optimality and
    inefficiency: What isn't a cost model of the lambda calculus?"
    exposed a fundamental problem with proposed algorithms for optimal
    reduction. Starting with Jean-Jacques L&#233;vy's seminal work in 1978,
    the goal of optimal reduction was to correctly normalize
    lambda-calculus terms without duplicating redexes. Various
    strategies were subsequently devised to realize optimal reduction,
    notably the solution of John Lamping at POPL 1990, then simplified
    and improved by Georges Gonthier, Mart&#237;n Abadi, and Jean-Jacques
    L&#233;vy at POPL 1992. Each solution used subtle bookkeeping mechanisms
    to control sharing.

    Lawall and Mairson showed that these bookkeeping mechanisms
    introduced a complexity and inefficiency of their own. They
    discovered terms that could be normalized in linear time, but whose
    bookkeeping costs required exponential time. They further showed
    that Frandsen and Sturtivant's cost model for lambda-calculus
    reduction, presented at FPCA 1991, needed to account for the size
    of intermediate terms, and that optimal-evaluation interpreters
    were at least exponentially slower than the proposed cost model.
    Lawall and Mairson concluded that the notion of optimality did not
    necessarily coincide with that of efficiency. As a consequence,
    different and possibly optimal evaluation strategies were still
    needed, as were more realistic cost models. Subsequent work in this
    area has focused on such cost models, on further analysis of the
    inherent complexity of optimal reduction, and on relaxing the
    optimality condition in exchange for lower bookkeeping overhead and
    greater overall efficiency.
