  NominationStatement: |
    Determining the granularity of parallel tasks is a long-standing 
    challenge for parallelizing programs. Overly fine-grained parallelization 
    incurs excessive overhead due to synchronization and control. Overly 
    coarse-grained parallelism limits parallelism by impeding load balancing. 
    Finding the grain size that hits the sweet spot usually requires non-trivial 
    tuning effort. Almost all parallel programming models (Cilk, OpenMP, TBB, 
    etc.) require the programmer to manually identify this grain size, which is 
    usually program and machine dependent. 
    
    This paper presents a solution to this problem: a practical and provably 
    efficient general automatic mechanism for finding the right granularity size 
    for parallel programs. Their approach works by gradually coarsening the 
    granularity until parity is achieved between the parallel and sequential 
    versions. Its practical usability is evaluated against hand tuned granularity 
    selection on the PBBS benchmark. The results often come close to hand-picked 
    grain sizes and even outperform them in some cases. The authors provide a 
    theorem that shows that their control algorithm achieves an execution time of 
    within a small constant factor of the optimal solution (under some assumptions
    that are met by a wide variety of programs).

  NominationStatement: |
    Given a code snippet, what is the likely name of the function it implements? 
    Can we predict properties of this snippet, such as how similar it is to other 
    code snippets? Can we answer these questions without executing any code, given 
    that we have access to large code databases? This work presents a novel 
    methodology for addressing these questions by learning from data a so-called 
    distributed representation of code snippets, similar to the distributed 
    representations of words or documents from the natural language processing domain. 
    The key technical innovation is a model that applies soft attention to the 
    representations of all paths in a code snippet; and can thus learn to identify 
    the most relevant paths for the task in hand. This highly-cited paper reports 
    significant advances over previous work in predicting method names compared to 
    previous work, includes a qualitative evaluation of the interpretability of the 
    learnt attention over the paths of a program, comes with an open-source 
    implementation, as well as online interactive demos.

   NominationStatement: |
    The paper presents PlanAlyzer, a first-of-its-kind static analyzer for the
    domain specific language (DSL) PlanOut. PlanOut is a leading DSL for expressing
    online experiments, which are a critical tool for designing and engineering
    online processes by internet companies. PlanAlyzer detects errors that can
    impact the validity of statistical conclusions. Previously, such experiments
    were only validated and analyzed by a human ad hoc effort. The paper lists
    various frequent potential pitfalls that would lead to an erroneous analysis of
    experiments, including failures of randomization, treatment assignment, or
    causal sufficiency. PlanAlyzer statically checks whether an input program
    involves one of these bad practices. Experimental results are provided for a
    few years' worth of real PlanOut programs from Facebook. A subset of these
    programs are mutated and PlanAlyzer yields precision and recall of 92% on the
    mutated corpus.

    Laboratories on a chip (LoCs) can be seen as the 'general-purpose' 
    CPU of microfluidic devices. This paper describes the design and 
    implementation of "BioScript", a programming language for LoCs that 
    allows biochemists to express microfluid experiments as programs. 
    This research exemplifies the use of techniques from programming 
    language theory and practice in order to satisfy the constraints 
    imposed by these systems while producing a language that is fit 
    for its purpose. This includes designing a type systems that helps 
    prevent scientists from accidentally causing unsafe chemical reactions 
    that could damage the lab itself or produce toxic gas.
    
    The authors demonstrate that as more platforms require programming 
    — increasingly by non-computer scientists — the creative mix and 
    application of well-studied theory can provide meaningful design

  NominationStatement: |
    Ethereum is the world's second largest cryptocurrency, with a current 
    market capitalization over $20 billion. It was the first to support 
    smart contracts---Turing complete programs stored on the blockchain, 
    and executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which perform transactions 
    with no human interaction. Bugs in these contracts can enable theft, 
    or render the managed funds permanently inaccessible.
    
    This paper addresses a particular kind of bug, exploiting the fact that 
    smart contracts consume “gas” as they run, and calls that run out of gas 
    are aborted. If an attacker can corrupt the state of a contract so that 
    all future calls run out of gas, then the funds it manages are permanently lost.
    MadMax can analyze any Ethereum contract by decompiling its byte code, then 
    searching for code patterns that are likely to be associated with three common 
    kinds of “out of gas” vulnerabilities, using the successful Datalog approach to 
    implement a data-flow analysis, context sensitive flow analysis, and memory 
    modeling for data structures. The result is an accurate and scalable analysis 
    that the authors applied to every smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain---over 
    90,000 of them. In 10 hours of analysis, MadMax flagged over 5% of these contracts 
    (managing about $2.8 billion) as potentially vulnerable to one of the three attacks. 
    Inspection of the first 13 flagged contracts, with 16 flagged vulnerabilities, 
    showed that 13 vulnerabilities were real---so only around 20% of flagged 
    vulnerabilities are false positives.
    
    Blockchain technology is currently attracting significant interest, and security 
    requirements are at its core. This paper shows beautifully how state-of-the-art 
    programming-language techniques can be brought to bear to improve the security of 
    the blockchain infrastructure we may all depend on in the future.

  Venue: PLDI 2018
  NominationStatement: |
    This paper presents a manifestly extremely useful framework for detecting 
    memory leaks in web applications.  The programmer provides a script that 
    specifies a “visible loop” in terms of states in a web application, and 
    the BLeak system flags objects that consistently exhibit a growing set of 
    outgoing references as potential leaks. Via appropriate hooks, any addition 
    of such a growth reference triggers the collection of a stack trace for 
    debugging.  In addition, the tool attributes importance to leak roots by 
    counting the sizes of reachable nodes (normalized by their count) in order 
    to help programmers identify where they should be focusing their debugging 
    effort first.  The results demonstrate great effectiveness: nearly 60 actual 
    and never-found-before bugs were identified and fixed in real-world applications, 
    leading to significant reductions in memory.

    This paper makes a substantial improvement to the state of production performance 
    profiling tools. The paper is widely accessible and will be of interest to 
    application, tool, and system developers. 
    
    Understanding application performance while it runs in production remains an open 
    problem with implications on what we can compute at any given time scale and how 
    we compute it. Historically, developers had two types of performance profilers at 
    their disposal. (1) Coarse-grained profiles interrupt programs and sample performance 
    counters or software events infrequently (e.g., gprof). (2) Fine-grained profilers 
    instrument programs (e.g., DeadSpy) or require an additional thread and software 
    configuration (e.g., SHIM). These types of tools make different trade offs. 
    Coarse-grained profilers are efficient, but they only detect only a limited class 
    of performance trends, e.g., the dominant method or thread that holds a lock for a 
    long time. Fine-grained profilers detect more nuanced performance issues, such as 
    useless writes, poor cache behavior, or program critical paths, but most have high 
    overhead because they require program instrumentation or require lots of state, 
    making them impractical for finding problems in deployment, where software is 
    exercised in hard to reproduce and unexpected ways.

    This paper introduces a new extremely low-overhead reservoir sampling approach that 
    requires no program instrumentation and limited state. It uses hardware debugging 
    registers and perfomance monitoring units (PMU) to capture values of memory locations.
    They prove the efficacy of the sampling approach to capture events that happen 
    frequently enough to cause performance problems. (Rare events are important for 
    correctness tools, but less so for performance tools.) The paper demonstrates their 
    approach is low overhead and yet reveals performance problems. It shows their tool 
    reveals actionable performance bugs related to consecutive reads and writes to the 
    same memory location (e.g., dead writes, silent stores, and redundant loads), but the 
    approach is general and will apply to many other pre-configured performance pathologies. 
    They show practical impact through changes they or developers make to a range of large 
    complicated multithreaded applications. Application and system developers will want to 
    use it.

  Venue: PLDI 2016
  NominationStatement: |
    The paper presents a practical solution to a common challenge: web
    programming with unstructured data in such formats as JSON, XML,
    and CSV. The solution is principled and uses the known idea of
    type inference in a new way, namely for external data at run
    time. Specifically, the paper presents a type system for external
    data that helps shorten access code and avoid unsafe lookups
    during data traversal. The paper also shows how to infer a type
    from example data, which makes the type system practical
    useable. Type inference happens at run-time and maps example data
    to a type that subsequent computation can use. In more detail,
    type inference proceeds in two steps: first a shape inferencer
    maps data to shapes via use of row variables, and then a type
    provider maps shapes to types. A key technical aspect of the shape
    inferencer is a preference relation that reflects both the
    authors' design principles and the host language F#. The paper
    proves the safety of code that uses the inferred types as long as
    the input data is no crazier than the example data.

    The evolution of multicore hardware has reached the point in which
    a single server divides its cores and memory into two or more Non
    Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) domains. Designing concurrent data
    structures is very challenging in general, and these NUMA
    architectures make it harder. This paper exploits the observation
    that NUMA multicore architectures increasingly resemble
    distributed systems. It introduces an approach for transforming
    sequential data structures into NUMA aware concurrent data
    structures. The approach combines data replication with per NUMA
    logging of updates, borrowed from distributed systems algorithms,
    and shared memory data consistency protocols. The approach is
    surprisingly effective for a range of data structures. This paper
    is not the final word, but it points in a new direction for
    designing concurrent algorithms for shared memory NUMA
    architectures.

    Programs are idiomatic: they consist of combinations of statements
    that regularly appear in other programs. Large code repositories,
    freely available for examination, can serve as a knowledge base of
    idioms, creating unique opportunities for automated analysis. This
    paper examines programs with known properties (such as names or
    types of variables), produces a statistical model, and applies the
    model on programs with unknown properties. The work emphasizes two
    aspects: a modeling of the relationships between syntactic program
    elements and the use of powerful probabilistic graphical models
    (conditional random fields), with fast inference algorithms
    tailored to prediction tasks in programs. These techniques
    significantly advance the state-of-the-art in statistical

    programming languages: by moving the level of discourse for some
    problem to just the right level, one gains tremendous benefits. In
    this case, the design of a little DSL for specifying peephole
    optimizations hits a sweet spot where one can both have practical,

    The paper demonstrates common algebraic structure shared by, among
    other things, sets, graphs, regular expressions, imperative
    programs, and datatypes. It then shows how this structure can be
    exploited in a generic way by a library to provide implementations
    of dominators, a function that turns a state machine into a
    corresponding regular expression, solutions to dataflow equations,
    and the knapsack problem. The key insight is that all of these
    problems are instances of linear algebra problems -- not over
    fields like the complex or real numbers, but instead over a
    "closed semi-ring", a structure with a bit less structure than a
    field. Importantly, a closed semi-ring doesn't have a notion of
    negation or reciprocals, which is what makes it work for all those
    structures mentioned earlier, as they don't have a natural notion
    of negation of reciprocal.  Although most of the individual

  Authors: Leo Meyerovich (University of California at Berkeley), Ariel Rabkin (Princeton University)
  Venue: OOPSLA 2013
  NominationStatement: |
    Based on a large survey and large repository analysis, this paper
    draws very interesting conclusions about what makes a programming
    language be adopted in practice (or not). Many design and
    implementation details that researchers and language designers
    traditionally find important (i.e. intrinsic features) seem not to
    be that important in practice. Instead, open source libraries,
    existing code, and experience strongly influence developers when
    selecting a language for a project. When considering intrinsic
    aspects of languages, developers prioritize expressivity over
    correctness. They perceive static types as primarily helping with
    the latter. Another finding is that developers quickly pick up new
    languages when needed. The reported data is interesting and gives
    plenty of food for thought for language designers. The study
    should also be interesting for anyone managing large software
    projects and having to make language choices.

  NominationStatement: |
    CLAP is an efficient technique for reproducing concurrency bugs
    that logs thread local execution and computes memory dependencies
    offline, allowing an observed concurrency bug to be
    reproduced. The principal contribution is the identification of a
    new approach to reproducing concurrency bugs that reduces
    overheads and reduces the observer effect seen in existing systems
    that inject synchronization points.

    This paper addresses a compiler optimization problem, namely
    generating SSE vector code for loops with data-driven control flow

  Authors: Bin Ren, Gagan Agrawal, Jim Larus, Todd Mytkowicz, Tomi Poutanen, Wolfram Schulte  
  Venue: CGO 2013
  NominationStatement: |
    Finding ways to parallelize important computations is now
    essential in creating a competitive product or service. This paper
    addresses the challenging problem of mapping a SIMD model of
    computation onto an irregular data structure and demonstrates the
    effectiveness of this approach for two important classes of
    problems: regular expression matching and evaluating forests of
    decision trees. The paper shows that with the proper intermediate
    language abstraction, such irregular computations can be mapped
    efficiently onto SIMD units and result in speedups of over 10
    times for random forest evaluation mapping the computation onto
    the SSE extensions of the x86 instruction set on a single core
    machine. These improvements result both from parallelizing the
    irregular computation and carefully laying out the data being
    manipulated to reduce the memory latency. By showing that the
    approach applies to two large interesting classes of irregular
    computations, the authors demonstrate the generality of their
    approach its potential for broad impact.

  Authors: Giuseppe Castagna, Zhiwu Xu  
  Venue: ICFP 2011
  NominationStatement: |
    The paper provides a semantic basis for the combination of
    subtyping and parametric polymorphism (generics in Java parlance)
    that has eluded researchers for quite some time. The paper builds
    on the more "intuitive" types-as-sets notion, in a principled way,
    and explains the issues with past attempts and give intuition for
    the presented models.  It has immediate application in typing XML,
    but appears to be much broader than that. The problem of semantic
    definition of types is generally an important and challenging one
    where we expect progress to come slowly. This paper seems to
    represent an important next step.

- Title: _[Safe Haskell](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2364524)_
  Authors: David Terei, Simon Marlow, Simon Peyton Jones, David Mazières
  Venue: Haskell Symposium 2012
  NominationStatement: |
    This paper describes a language extension of Haskell that is
    intended to make it possible to confine and safely execute
    untrusted, possibly malicious code. It leverages Haskell's type
    system, and imposes relatively few requirements on the development
    of Haskell programs.  There's also a "Safe Haskell" subset of the
    language being identified that has particularly nice properties,
    and the compiler is able to automatically infer whether programs
    are in this subset. The design and approach of Safe Haskell should
    be of interest to the wider CACM community, even though (or in
    particular, because) some of Safe Haskell's ideas are made
    possible because Haskell is already a relatively safe language to
    start with.

  NominationStatement: |
    This paper takes a well-known idea, work-stealing to exploit
    parallel hardware, and asks why it doesn't work as well as it
    should. It identifies the key sources of overhead, then conducts a
    substantial empirical study of 4 alternative strategies for
    avoiding that overhead.  The result is that one of these
    techniques is shown to incur low-overhead (15%), while enabling
    just as much parallelism as the others - more bang for the
    buck. This is a reconsideration of a known idea that improves on
    it substantially.

  NominationStatement: |
    There has been a lot of buzz about mixtures of machine and human
    computation. For the most part there has been little programmatic
    support for constructing such systems. This paper makes an initial
    step in that direction. It defines an API that permits
    crowd-source computation to be invoked from a program like
    ordinary function calls.  This is coupled with a runtime system
    that manages the execution of the crowd-sources computation,
    determines when sufficient confidence in the results is achieved,
    manages things like repricing and restarting crowd-source tasks,
    and seeks to maximize parallelism in the execution of the
    crowd-source tasks. This is an interesting new idea that provides
    a direction for people to build on.

  Authors: Amir Ben-Amram, Samir Genaim  
  Venue: POPL 2013
  NominationStatement: |
    The paper studies the complexity of the linear ranking problem,
    namely the problem that, given a loop described as a set of linear
    constraints over a finite set of integer variables, determines if
    there exists a linear ranking decreasing function for that
    loop. The existence of this function implies termination, although
    the converse may not hold. The great contribution is set by moving
    from rational/real valued variables, which is PTIME, to integer
    valued variables where the decidability of the problem was still
    open. The authors proved that the Linear Ranking Problem for
    Integer variables is decidable and it is coNP-complete.
    Algorithmic methods for synthesizing linear ranking functions have
    been introduced and restrictions have been studied in order to
    make the problem PTIME.

  Authors: Paul Gazzillo, Robert Grimm
  Venue: PLDI 2012
  NominationStatement: |
    This paper addresses the long standing problem of correctly
    parsing both of the two underlying languages that comprise what we
    know as C: C proper, and the C preprocessor. Most tools do not
    attempt to parse both.  Most C compilers parse a single
    configuration of the program rather than the full set of possible
    configurations. The authors provide a nice overview of the
    challenges of parsing C and explore this concretely with the
    challenging example of the Linux kernel. They introduce
    'Fork-Merge LR (FMLR)' parsing which they use to address the
    challenge of parsing across multiple configuration
    possibilities. The outcome is a publicly available tool,
    'SuperC'. This paper is accessible to a broad audience, it has
    concrete applications, and has some very nice computer science
    behind it. The work has clear applications, addresses a very well
    established problem, and is bound to be a milestone publication.

  Authors: John Launchbury, Iavor S. Diatchki, Thomas DuBuisson, Andy Adams-Moran
  Venue: ICFP 2012
  NominationStatement: |
    Cloud computing provides new opportunities for individuals to
    cheaply take advantage of tremendous computing power for
    occasional expensive computations, but the capability comes with
    new challenges. This paper specifically focuses on privacy. In
    particular, you might imagine encrypting your private before
    sending it to the cloud computers, in order to ensure secrets are
    not leaked. But how can a cloud computer compute on encrypted
    data? The SMC (secure multi-party computation) community has
    studied this challenge and has come up with algorithms that can
    successfully operate on encrypted data, without revealing that
    data to the cloud computers that are actually doing the
    computation.  Unfortunately, their algorithms are typically
    expressed via circuits, making an efficient implementation more
    challenging than it should be.  This paper shows how a
    languages-based perspective can bring powerful tools to bear on
    the problem. Indeed, the paper shows how to get order-of-magnitude
    improvements to the implementation of AES encryption in an SMC
    setting. Even better: the overall structure of the AES
    implementation is similar to the non-SMC version. One key
    technical development that makes this possible is a new array
    lookup primitive that provides good leverage for expressing the
    algorithm and its efficient implementation.

    This exemplary paper explains how a variety of techniques that are

    dynamic type checking, the QuickCheck property-based verification
    tool, model checking, and aiming for a verifying rather than a

- Title: _[Fast Restore of Checkpointed Memory using Working Set Estimation](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1952682.1952695)_
  Authors: Irene Zhang, Alex Garthwaite, Yuri Baskakov, Kenneth C. Barr
  Venue: VEE 2011
  NominationStatement: |
    The paper describes a clever technique for restoring checkpointed
    OS-level virtual machines, which significantly outperforms both
    eager (restore all memory pages, then start VM) and lazy (page in
    as needed) techniques. While the checkpoint is computed, page
    accesses are tracked for roughly the time required to restore the
    VM. Accessed pages are restored eagerly, the rest lazily. If
    everything were entirely deterministic, this should restore
    exactly the needed pages eagerly, and it seems to come close. This
    is a VMWare paper, and I believe the technique is used in
    practice. It is in many ways the ideal CACM paper: It exposes the
    reader to a probably new problem space, the paper is easy to read,
    and probably unusually easy to shorten to the CACM page limit.  It
    is a simple but interesting and meaningful result. It also exposes
    the reader to the "minimum mutator utilization" metrics from the
    GC literature, which may themselves be interesting to some
    readers.

- Title: "_[SugarJ: Library-based Syntactic Language Extensibility](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2076021.2048099)_"
  Authors: Sebastian Erdweg, Tillmann Rendel, Christian Kastner, Klaus Ostermann
  Venue: OOPSLA 2011
  NominationStatement: |
    This paper appeared in OOPSLA 2011, pages 391-406. It addresses
    the problem of adding domain-specific language extensions,
    including domain-specific syntax extensions, to an existing
    programming language through the use of library modules. The main
    claim is that the approach "maintains the composability and
    scoping properties of ordinary libraries" (abstract). The
    mechanism is also self-applicable, which allows one to write
    syntax extensions that help the process of writing syntax
    extensions, and it also composes at this meta-level.

    The approach builds on Java, SDF, and Stratego. There is also a
    novel incremental parsing technique that supports changing syntax
    within a source file. Composition of syntax extensions works
    through the module import mechanism of the host language. There
    is, however, a caveat that grammars do not always compose, so
    there is a possibility that importing two syntax extensions may
    cause an error. In summary, the paper both combines a number of
    existing techniques (from SDF and Stratego) in a very elegant and
    well-thought out language design.

    The paper has a nice demonstration of the ideas, with examples
    that will be well received by a CACM audience. One example shows
    how to write a layered XML extension, including an embedding of
    XML Schema. The XML Schema extension shows how context-sensitive
    checks (like type checking) can be accomplished in their
    framework.

    Support for domain-specific languages is something that has been
    gaining steam in the PL community for years, and it seems like
    this paper can help bring these ideas to a wider audience. In
    particular, an idea from earlier work (on MetaBorg) is adapted
    that allows the writer of a syntax extension to use the concrete
    syntax of a syntax extension in the description of how to
    transform the extension into the underlying language (such as
    Java). This is itself a nice demonstration of the
    self-applicability of the syntax extension mechanisms and how such
    syntax extension mechanisms can be implemented as a library (see
    section 5.1). Another nice feature of the design is the well
    thought out way that extensions are staged during processing of a
    compilation unit (file). This process, described in section 4.2,
    doesn't seem too deep, and may seem obvious in hindsight, but it's
    the kind of thing that can have a long lasting impact on the
    field, as it just seems right. Brought together, all these
    mechanisms seem to make a fundamental difference, and seem to
    represent a leap forward in syntactic extensibility. In
    particular, the way that the mechanism is demonstrated to be
    self-applicable is extremely impressive. Furthermore, this
    self-applicability allows for an virtuous cycle of improvements in
    program libraries, as is shown to some extent in the paper with
    the implementation of support for concrete syntax transformations.

  Authors: Susmit Sarkar (University of Cambridge), Peter Sewell (University of Cambridge), Jade Alglave (Oxford University), Luc Maranget (INRIA), Derek Williams (IBM)
  Venue: PLDI 2011
  NominationStatement: |
    An overlapping set of authors wrote an earlier paper entitled
    "x86-TSO: A Rigorous and Usable Programmer's Model for x86
    Multiprocessors", published in July 2010 as a Research
    Highlight. That paper describes the easy-to-understand, but
    formally describable, and empirically tested memory model for
    x86. This paper describes the analogous effort for IBMs Power
    architecture.

    The paper gives a high-level description of some of the tricky
    behavior exhibited by Power and how to understand it. The paper
    builds an executable abstract machine and compares runs of the
    abstract machine with runs on Power hardware for a large suite of
    "litmus tests".  Execution of the abstract machine is nontrivial
    and involves a search for all possible executions. The paper
    explains example programs and tricky behavior via simple diagrams,
    and it explains the abstract machine with words, while the formal
    definitions are all in a technical report. The paper is an
    impressive tour-de-force of what programming language technology
    can do to help understand a complicated processor.  For example,
    the authors defined their own language for specifying abstract
    machines, along with a translator to executable OCaml code and
    other tools. Additionally, the authors did a good job of making
    the abstract machine as simple as possible, in the face of a
    massively complicated processor.

    This provides an interesting contrast to the x86 paper. The x86
    paper gives rise to a model (essentially TSO) simple enough to be
    described operationally in a way that is probably useful to a
    typical assembly programmer. The Power model is inherently much
    more complex, in that the architecture exposes more speculation,
    and provides a very diverse set of memory fence instructions, with
    very subtle semantics. The present paper derives a model that is
    also mathematically precise, but probably too complex for a
    typical programmer. Nonetheless, it fills an important void, and
    finally answers important questions that have been creating
    confusion for years. A major question throughout the development
    of the latest C and C++ standards was whether the provided atomic
    operations were implementable on PowerPC, and at what cost. This
    allows those questions to be precisely answered, and finally
    allows a compiler writer to confidently and correctly hide the
    architectural complexity. If the C++ standards committee had had
    access to such a description, we would have avoided months of
    debate.

  NominationStatement: |
    This paper presents AFix, a development tool that uses the results
    of an atomicity violation detector (in this case, CTrigger) to
    automatically construct patches that fix the detected
    violations. It does so by placing critical sections around
    accesses that might cause atomicity violations (using various
    simple static analyses), and then merging sections together to
    reduce overhead and the likelihood of deadlock. On several
    real-world bugs, AFix is able to either completely fix or
    partially mitigate the effect of atomicity bugs, often better than
    manual patches. This paper was well motivated (the example in the
    introduction was very nicely chosen to illustrate the pertinent
    issues), well written, and explained a set of intuitive techniques
    clearly. In addition, the results seemed very promising. The
    strategy presented by the paper is fairly simple, but surprisingly
    effective, at least for fixing bugs that fall under its failure
    model. While it's easy to see many sources of potential
    inefficiency and incompleteness in the proposed algorithm, the
    empirical results make the case that the technique can fix real
    bugs with negligible overhead. This is one of the first papers to
    attack the problem of automated bug fixing, so it should be of
    wide interest.

    The committee nominates this paper (POPL 2011) together with the
    follow-up paper in PLDI 2011 by William Harris and Sumit
    Gulwani. Each of the papers is a great paper, and we believe they
    would be even better together as a combined CACM article. The
    theme of the papers is program synthesis in service of the general
    population. Specifically, the papers develop synthesis techniques
    that make it easier to use spreadsheets.  The POPL 2011 paper
    focuses on string manipulation, while the PLDI 2011 paper focuses
    on table manipulation. Both papers enable "programming by example"
    in the sense that a user can show, with the existing functionality
    of the spreadsheet, an example of what needs to be done, and the
    implemented tool will then generate code for doing that kind of
    thing and apply it to all other instances in the table. If the
    result isn't what the user wanted, then one can simply iterate the
    process.  Both papers develop new program synthesis techniques and
    demonstrate via implementations and experiments that they work
    well in practice. These papers have broad appeal and show nicely
    that tools that are based on programming language techniques can
    be widely useful.

    This paper describes a new language, Lime, that is designed to be

    the notion of purity into the concepts of valueness and
    locality. Various types can be declared as value types, which must
    have the property of being "deeply immutable." Locality means
    "that no side effects can be propagated through static fields or
    information reachable from them." Both "local static" methods
    whose arguments are all value types and "local instance" methods
    whose arguments are all of value types are pure functions. The
    language also has a kind of polymorphism that allows the locality
    of a method to depend on the context in which it invoked (called
    "glocal").

    Lime supports fine-grained parallelism (on value types) through
    collective operations, which can be user-defined. Types such as
    bitstrings and small arrays can be made data-parallel.

    Lime also supports stream computing using tuple types and its
    "task" and "connect" mechanisms. The connect operator (written
    "=\>") connects an output stream in a task to another task's input
    stream. Such connections are atomically buffered to help with flow
    control. (There is also a technique that can be used for rate
    matching.) To ease the connection between streams produced by
    tasks, Lime has a "match" operator and also statically checks
    connections to prevent "errors and scheduling
    complications". However, it does have ways to send messages
    upstream or downstream to aid in configuration. All these
    mechanisms merely describe a dataflow graph; starting the
    computation is done separately, allowing the compiler to output
    the dataflow computation to hardware and providing the opportunity
    for various optimizations.

    Tasks can also be used for coarse-grained parallelism with its
    "split" and "join" primitives, that operate on streams.

    Lime's support for compilation to various kinds of hardware is
    also aided by a mechanism that can declare when a set of types is
    complete.  This is done by allowing classes and interfaces to name
    all their direct subtypes. The evaluation is impressive, with C
    and FPGA executions performing orders of magnitude faster compared
    to the baseline code, although the authors say that their FPGA
    backend is not completely mature.

  Authors: Geoffrey Mainland (Harvard University), Greg Morrisett (Harvard University)
  Venue: Haskell Symposium 2010
  NominationStatement: |
    This paper provides an excellent overview of the state of the art
    of domain-specific language (DSL) programming within a functional
    language such as Haskell. As running example, it introduces
    Nikola, a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell. Nikola is
    suitable for expressing first-order array computations. Nikola
    programs can thus be written within Haskell, having all the
    high-level features and the type system at the disposal. Despite
    being embedded, the Haskell compiler has access to a
    representation of the Nikola program, can analyze its sharing
    structure, can invoke a Nikola-specific compiler behind the
    scenes, generate code for the CUDA framework and have the program
    run on the GPU. The paper demonstrates that advantages of
    standalone DSLs and embedded DSLs can be combined without imposing
    any extra burden on the programmer. The authors show preliminary
    performance tests that indicate that it is possible to achieve the
    performance of hand-written CUDA code when starting from a Haskell
    program. The paper is interesting to people interested in DSLs
    because it provides a good overview of typical problems arising
    when embedding DSLs such as loss of sharing, and it gives
    pragmatic explanations how these problems can be avoided. It
    furthermore demonstrates that even embedded DSLs can generate
    efficient code, and therefore allow users of otherwise rather
    low-level languages such as CUDA to work in higher-level languages
    instead.

    Understanding if two programs are equivalent is an essential part
    of reasoning about the correctness of program
    transformations. This paper applies the modern technique of
    step-indexed Kripke logical relations to the old problem of
    reasoning about program equivalence in the presence of expressive
    language constructs, such as recursive types, abstract types,
    general references and call/cc. It also discusses how reasoning
    ability changes under restrictions to the language, giving
    examples properties that are true only if the language lacks
    higher-order state or control effects such as call/cc. Although
    the mathematical machinery necessary for this work is highly
    technical at times, much of the presentation in the paper is given
    in an informal, pedagogic style based on clean "visual" proof
    sketches.

  Venue: GPCE 2010
  NominationStatement: |
    The paper introduces "Lightweight Modular Staging" (LMS), a
    technique for expressing multi-stage programming. Staged
    programming allows control over the time when a piece of code is
    executed. In particular, code can be executed at compile time
    already, thereby allowing a disciplined form of program
    generation. Most programming languages that support staging
    require explicit source code annotations that delay or force the
    execution of a marked piece of code. LMS is different in that it
    does not have annotations on the term level: instead, simply
    changing the type signatures of a program fragment is sufficient
    to lift that program to a staged version. Additional optimizations
    can then be implemented separately (using Scala's "trait"s),
    without touching the original code. LMS is particularly attractive
    for implementing embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs),
    because the staging features can be used to perform code
    optimizations in the background and the lightweight syntax keeps
    the surface syntax clean. This is confirmed by the fact that the
    Stanford Pervasive Parallelism Lab is already using LMS
    successfully to build domain-specific languages. The paper is a
    good example how modern language technology can help to solve
    long-standing and difficult problems such as staging: with Scala's
    general-purpose features, the staging system as described in this
    paper can be implemented as a library, without need for further
    language extensions.

  NominationStatement: |
    Synthesizing program fragments from high-level specifications has
    the potential to make programs more readable and programmers more
    productive. The problem has many challenging elements, however,
    including how to keep specifications concise, how to convert these
    specifications into code, and how to integrate such synthesis into
    general-purpose programming languages. This paper provides a key
    insight: decision procedures that generate witnesses can form the
    basis for synthesis. As a case study, the paper develops this idea
    for two useful decision procedures: linear arithmetic and
    constraints over sets.  Further, the authors show how to
    incorporate such synthesis into Scala as a form of pattern
    matching. The resulting programs are concise and easier to
    understand than the versions without synthesis. The decision
    procedures are run at compile time to synthesize the desired code,
    and if no solution exists, the tool reports the failure
    statically. In summary, this paper describes a cool idea that
    could substantially change programming practice.

  Venue: PLDI 2010
  NominationStatement: |
    This paper describes Verve, an operating system running on
    standard hardware that is verified to ensure type and memory
    safety. The verification is automatic, using a combination of two
    different layers. Due to this combination, a large part of the
    operating system kernel can actually be written in a high-level
    programming language (here: C\#). The automatic nature of the
    verification brings verification times down to a number of
    minutes. This means that for the first time it is possible to
    develop extension of the system on the fly, and to perform quick
    experiments with new designs. The paper presents an entertaining
    and accessible introduction to the various issues that are
    involved in building such a system. Verve illustrates that
    building much more robust and secure operating systems is
    feasible. Given the widespread vulnerability of existing operating
    systems, Verve is of broad interest to the CACM community because
    it shows that alternatives are possible.

  Authors: Cormac Flanagan, Stephen N. Freund
  Venue: PLDI 2009
  NominationStatement: |
    Past work on dynamic data race detection had to choose between
    fast but imprecise race detectors that report false alarms
    vs. slow but precise race detectors that never report false
    alarms. The latter category is typically based on classical
    "vector clock" operations, where a single operation requires time
    linear in the number of program threads. The key insight behind
    the FastTrack dynamic data race detection algorithm introduced in
    this paper is that the full generality of vector clocks is not
    necessary in over 99% of these read and write operations in
    practice. Instead, a more lightweight representation of the
    happens-before information can be constructed using
    "epochs". Experimental results on Java benchmarks show that this
    approach is an order of magnitude faster than a traditional
    vector-clock race detector, thereby representing a significant
    advance over classical work in this area. This paper includes a
    comprehensive comparison with past work, including the previously
    nominated "Goldilocks" paper. Though both papers address the same
    high-level problem, they take very different approaches. FastTrack
    has shown how past algorithms based on vector clocks can be made
    significantly more efficient and scalable, thereby providing a
    perspective on a large body of past work in this area. Another
    SIGPLAN-nominated Research Highlights paper, "Goldilocks", is also
    highly innovative and takes a different approach that is not based
    on vector clocks.

  Authors: Yin Wang, Stephanie Lafortune, Terence Kelly, Manjunath Kudlur, Scott Mahlke
  Venue: POPL 2009
  NominationStatement: |
    Deadlock is a difficult problem for the average programmer who
    must now confront multicore hardware. The Gadara project offers a
    very interesting possible solution. The attached POPL paper
    provides a theoretical foundation for dynamic deadlock avoidance
    in concurrent programs that employ conventional mutual exclusion
    and synchronization primitives. Beginning with control flow graphs
    extracted from program source code, it constructs a formal model
    of the program and then applies Discrete Control Theory to
    automatically synthesize deadlock avoidance control logic that is
    implemented by program instrumentation. At run time, the control
    logic avoids deadlocks by postponing lock acquisitions. Discrete
    Control Theory guarantees that the instrumented program cannot
    deadlock. The control logic is maximally permissive: it postpones
    lock acquisitions only when necessary to prevent deadlocks, and
    therefore permits maximal runtime concurrency.  Additonal
    publications on the prototype system have appeared in top fora in
    DCT, systems, and programming languages: WODES'08, OSDI'08. The
    OSDI paper is attached as well. This research is a very nice
    combination of rigor and novelty. The authors have a working
    prototype and have applied it to real software including Apache,
    BIND, and OpenLDAP; it works as advertised, with very tolerable
    performance overhead. This approach potentially makes a
    significant contribution to enhancing the programmability of
    multicore processors for the mainstream.

- Title: "_[Generic Discrimination: Sorting and Partitioning Unshared Data in Linear Time](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1411220)_"
  Author: Fritz Henglein
  Venue: ICFP 2008
  NominationStatement: |
    Everyone knows that sorting a collection of *n* elements requires
    a number of comparisons proportional to *n* log *n*.  Distribution
    sort over certain kinds of data works in time linear in the number
    of elements, but is a "specialty" sort, useful only in special
    circumstances. After reading this paper, you may reverse this
    idea.  Henglein shows how to generalize distribution sort to a
    wide range of data. Assuming a base type is suitable for
    distribution sort, he shows how products, sums, and lists of such
    data are also suitable for distribution sort, relegating *n* log
    *n* sorts to the "specialty" case.  Henglein argues convincingly
    that the right interface for an abstract data type to supply is
    not comparison and not sorting, but a mild generalization of
    sorting which he calls a discriminator, in terms of which the
    other two may be defined. While the technique may be applied in
    any programming language, it fits particularly well with a
    functional language where it is easy to compose sort operators on
    component types to build sort operators on structures, and where
    advanced type systems allow one to ensure type safety while doing
    so. Henglein presents complete code in Haskell. We should expect
    the technique to spread to other languages; the new notion of C++
    concepts, which resemble Haskell type classes, are well suited for
    supporting defining functions based on type structure. The paper
    is a joy to read.
  Addendum: |
    Some readers may be confused by a line in the abstract and by some
    of the material in Section 8.1. Clarifications for these appear
    below. The line in the abstract "Having only a binray equality
    test on a type requires *&Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>)* time to find all
    the occurrences of an element in a list of length n, for each
    element in the list" may confuse some. It may be clearer to say,
    "Having only a binary equality test on a type requires quadratic
    time to partition a list into groups of equal elements".

    Table 1 in Section 8.1 may confuse some, because it gives times on
    the assumption that comparison of two elements of size *|v|* and
    *|w|* requires time proportional to *|v|+|w|*, whereas it is much
    more commonfor comparing elements to require time proportional to
    *min(|v|,|w|)*. For example, lexical comparison of two strings of
    length *|v|* and *|w|* requires the latter time, while reversing
    two strings (a linear-time operation on linked lists) and then
    performing a lexical comparison requires the former time. The
    latter operation is inefficient -- it would be better to reverse
    each string once, then sort using lexical comparison. But common
    libraries based on comparison operators may seduce a programmer
    into including reversal into the comparison operator, and the
    whole point of Table 1 is to point out the cost of such seduction.

  Authors: Tayfun Elmas, Shaz Qadeer, Serdar Tasiran
  Venue: PLDI 2007
  NominationStatement: |
    The paper describes a precise and reasonably fast
    data-race-detection algorithm. Their implementation takes the form
    of a modified JVM that detects all data races as defined by the
    Java memory model, and throws an exception when a race is
    encountered. It also supports transactional memory. As far as I
    know, this is the first such implementation that is fast enough to
    at least raise the question of whether this could be done
    routinely as part of production code execution. Although the
    performance measurements in the paper are not such that we can
    declare this a solved problem, I think this paper points at an
    interesting possible solution path to two hard (and, thanks to the
    widespread adoption of multicore processors) critical parallel
    programming problems: 1. Dealing with data races is the most
    difficult aspect of parallel program debugging. Since such bugs
    are usually not easily reproducible, they may escape testing, and
    may go unreported for long periods of time. Debugging may require
    months, since the actual data race is often no longer visible when
    a failure results, requiring the problem be reproduced repeatedly
    with increasingly instrumented programs. An exception at the time
    of the race avoids this problem. 2. (Not pointed out in the paper,
    since I think nobody appreciated it at the time.) It has become
    increasingly clear that we do not know how to fully specify the
    semantics of a multithreaded language like Java that, for security
    reasons, must specify some semantics for data races. The Java
    memory model (POPL 05) is the most successful attempt, but it has
    recently become clear that it too has some surprising and
    undesirable properties. If we could requrie that data races
    produce exceptions, these issues disappear. I believe there is now
    some ongoing work that looks at hardware support for data-race
    detection, that might greatly reduce the performance costs, and
    eventually make the "data-race as exception" model viable for a
    much larger class of applications. This paper is a great first
    step toward something that might actually result in a major
    advance in shared memory parallel programming, whether it uses
    transactional memory, or continues to be based on locks.

  Venue: PLDI 2008
  NominationStatement: |
    This paper appeared in PLDI 2008 and was coauthored by Alex Aiken
    and two of his Ph.D. students, Isil Dillig and Thomas Dillig. It
    provides an elegant and scalable solution to a decades-old
    challenge in the area of program analysis viz., how to perform
    precise intra- and inter-procedural path-sensitive program
    analysis without incurring the exponential increase in space and
    time that arises in a naive code duplication approach? And how to
    perform such an analysis for recursive programs? They introduce a
    new approach based on constraint systems to address this problem
    by defining constraints that capture the exact path- and
    context-sensitive condition under which a program property
    holds. The resulting constraint system may not be solvable in
    general. However, to answer a "may" or a "must" query regarding a
    program property, they can extract necessary or sufficient
    conditions from the constraint system which can be solved i.e.,
    they specialize the exact path condition to the query being asked.
    Further, these extracted necessary/sufficient conditions are
    typically small enough to make the approach scalable to large
    software -- they have implemented this approach in the Saturn
    system and used it to analyze over 6MLOC in the entire Linux
    kernel. They also use "unobservable variables" to model
    interactions with the environment (such as user input) as well as
    to support modular program analysis.  Their first set of
    experimental results quantify the size of necessary and sufficient
    conditions for pointer operations. Their second set of results
    applies their approach to identifying null-dereference errors.
    Both experiments were performed on OpenSSH, Samba, and the Linux
    kernel.  The results for null-dereference analysis in Figure 7
    compare inter- and intra-procedural path-sensitive analysis with
    just intra-procedural path-sensitive analysis, and shows that the
    former results in order-of-magnitude reductions in false positive
    reports compared to the latter. Like my other nominations, I
    believe that the authors can do a good job of rewriting the
    content of this paper for the general CACM audience. Some of the
    formalism in the current version of the paper may not be
    accessible to a large audience, and will need to be toned down in
    the CACM version. However, the basic concepts of inter- and
    intra-procedural path-sensitive analysis can be conveyed by simple
    examples such as the queryUser() example discussed in Section
    1. This paper is also a good illustration of how far approaches
    such as constraint systems have progressed for program analysis
    tools.

    entire proof is verified by the Coq proof assistant. "Complete

    four different intermediate languages. The paper shows how to
    certify that when the compiler generates code, then safety

    Network administrators, financial analysts, scientists, and many

    variable-width ASCII records and data-dependent number of
    fixed-width binary records. Those formats typically don't have
    parsing, querying, analysis, or transformation tools readily
    available. Thus motivated, researchers (including Fisher et al)
    have developed a variety of ad hoc data description
    languages. What is still missing, though, is a semantics and
    meta-theory for such languages, or anything to play the role the
    lambda calculus plays in underpinning programming language design
    and implementation. That is the gap that this paper fills, by
    defining a core calculus called the Data Dependency Calculus, and
    giving it a formal semantics and meta-theory. The paper
    demonstrates a formal translation from one data description
    language (IPADS) into DDC, and illustrates how features from other
    languages might similarly be translated. This is the first time
    anyone has tried to give a formal treatment to the wild and woolly

  NominationStatement: |
    Describes "synchronous queues", a fundamental data structure used
    to implement hand-offs or "rendezvous" between threads.  This
    implementation was immediately integrated into the
    java.util.concurrent component of Sun's standard Java library, and
    has thus already had practical impact. The data structure is
    commonly used with the Java Executor framework and, as is shown by
    measurements in the paper, may rather spectacularly impact the
    performance of some applications using it. This is in some sense
    the canonical data structure that involves blocking or waiting,
    and for which conventional sequential performance metrics are
    hence inapplicable. It's a great example of how to design a data
    structure, for which, in a sense, only concurrency considerations
    matter. We believe this will expose readers to an area of

  Authors: Joshua Auerbach, David F. Bacon, Daniel T. Iercan, Christoph M. Kirsch, V. T. Rajan, Harald Roeck, Rainer Trummer
  Venue: LCTES 2007
  NominationStatement: |
    Java and real-time are terms that aren't often used together. This
    paper changes that. Real-time systems programming involves low
    levels of abstraction, making real-time systems difficult to test
    and requiring them to be re-certified every time the software or
    hardware environment changes. This paper introduces Exotasks to
    Java to raise the level of abstraction. Exotasks add deterministic
    timing, even in the presence of other Java threads and across
    changes of hardware and software platform. The authors built a
    quad-rotor model helicopter, the JAviator, to test the concepts of
    the work. They tested the system with actual flights. When the
    system fails, the helicopter crashes! Beyond the richness of the
    technical details, this paper should appeal to CACM readers. There
    is a real problem, clever language solutions, and an interesting
    application demonstration complete with photographs. The work is
    conducted within the broader context of IBM's effort to establish
    a common Java-based real time programming environment.

  Authors: Frances Perry, Lester Mackey, George A. Reis, Jay Ligattii, David I. August, David Walker
  Venue: PLDI 2007
  NominationStatement: |
    This paper was one of two best papers from PLDI 2007. It spans the
    areas of fault-tolerant computing, type systems, and
    production-strength compilers to provide a unique approach to
    formalization and detection of Single Event Upset (SEU) faults,
    motivated by the increasing number of transient hardware faults
    observed in real systems. Their approach builds on the general
    strategy of using redundancy for fault tolerance by executing two
    independent copies of the program in two separate threads. Prior
    to writing data out to a memory-mapped output device, the results
    of the two computations are checked for equivalence. (This
    research focuses on fault detection in processors, and assumes
    that other techniques such as error-correcting codes are used to
    achieve fault tolerance in memories.) They introduce a
    Fault-Tolerant Typed Assembly Language, TAL<sub>FT</sub>, that
    ensures that all well-typed programs exhibit fail-safe behavior in
    the presence of transient faults i.e., a corrupt value can never
    be written to a memory-mapped output device. TAL<sub>FT</sub> can
    help identify cases when conventional optimizations may not be
    sound from the viewpoint of fault tolerance. Finally, they
    implemented their reliability transformations in the Princeton
    VELOCITY compiler, and provided empirical results for 22
    SPECint2000 and MediaBench benchmarks. These results show that the
    overhead of fault tolerance is about 34% on average instead of the
    100% that may have been expected from dual redundancy. I
    especially like this paper for CACM because it spans a number of
    different areas, and I believe that the authors can do a good job
    of rewriting the content of this paper for the general CACM
    audience. The basic single-event-upset fault model is well
    motivated by current technology trends and yet simple to
    understand. Overall, the paper should be an eye-opener to folks
    who equate compilers with the Dragon book and haven't been keeping
    up with the latest research in compiler technology such as the
    fault tolerance application studied in this paper.

- Title: _[Dynamic Multigrained Parallelization on the Cell Broadband Engine](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1229428.1229445)_
  Authors: Filip Blagojevic, Dimitris S. Nikolopoulos, Alexandros Stamatakis, Christos D. Antonopoulos
  Venue: PPoPP 2007
  NominationStatement: |
    With the advent of multicores, parallel programming is again one
    of the most important issues in computer science. This paper
    describes and evaluates a scheduling strategy for parallel
    programs executing on an IBM cell processor. It exploits coarse
    grain parallelism whenever there is an adequate supply of tasks.
    Otherwise, it attempts to exploit fine grain-parallelism. Fine
    grain parallelism is given lower priority because it tends to
    incur more overhead than coarse-grain parallelism. The target
    machine has an interesting, much talked about architecture. It is
    a heterogeneous machine, a likely characteristic of future
    multicores. The application is representative of an important
    class of applications that contain relatively simple parallelism
    at multiple levels. The paper describes an excellent case study in
    parallel programming that illustrates some of the immense
    difficulties that programmers are likely to face in the brave new
    world of multicore systems.
