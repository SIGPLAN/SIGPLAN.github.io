title: "SIGPLAN Research Highlights"
---
Since 2008, SIGPLAN has selected papers from its sponsored conferences that are of high quality and broad appeal.  These papers, called SIGPLAN Research Highlights, are selected by a committee representing SIGPLAN's major conferences and elected officials.
These papers are also recommended for consideration for the [CACM](http://cacm.acm.org/) Research
Highlights section. 

### Nomination Process

The committee considers nominated papers from two sources:

-   **Committee**: The SIGPLAN Research Highlights Committee,
    working closely with the program chairs from the conferences they
    represent, will review and nominate papers from the conferences listed above
    for consideration by the full committee.

-   **Community**: Any SIGPLAN member may nominate a paper appearing in a SIGPLAN conference. Authors may not nominate their own papers.

 Nominations can be made at this [website](http://cacm.sigplan.org).


### SIGPLAN Research Highlights Papers
  As of November 2014, 43 papers have been recognized by the SIGPLAN
  Research Highlights committee, and 19 SIGPLAN papers have appeared in
  CACM, 12 from the SIGPLAN committee and 7 that were solicited directly by the CACM committee. 
  This [webpage](/Newsletters/CACM/Papers) contains the full list of papers.
